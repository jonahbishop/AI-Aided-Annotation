export let DEMO_Legal_Reputation = `Contacts familiar with the industry, and the politics of regulation, see Monsanto (as the company is still known) as overly aggressive in its approach to public debate, which raises risks in relation to litigation. In the short term, you (and the EPA) are likely to face more legal challenges from NGOs as a result of the EPA's permissive approach to regulation. In the longer term, retailers, among others, feel that glyphosate will have to be phased out - though without saying precisely why. 

In the course of speaking to relevant stakeholders about regulatory risks associated with your products, a number of them volunteered views on Monsanto's reputation and standing, and potential risks that arise from this, which may be of interest as you retire the brand name following your merger with Bayer.

A senior executive at Brunswick, the communications and PR group, who has worked on both sides of various Monsanto deals, summarised: "I can understand that Monsanto does not want to concede any legal ground over RoundUp or any other products. But I have less understanding of why it feels it necessary to cultivate a 'bad boy' image in its industry. This dented its chances on the Syngenta deal, for example, and leads to a generally hostile courtroom attitude among jurors in the various cases that it gets involved in - who, I am sure, will be tempted to 'take down' Monsanto on some issue or other just to balance the scales. Even Exxon has softened its 'scorched earth' tactics on climate change." 

An experienced agrochemical industry consultant also commented on your image within the industry: "Developments in California on glyphosate are striking a chord with the public. And the dicamba rollout was hardly a model of corporate best practice - even so, Monsanto blamed its own customers. The company regularly goes to 'DEFCON 1' on the slightest challenge from the environmental, academic or scientific community. I am sure Bayer is aware of this and will make adjustments. The issue is one of softening its image, not abandoning its arguments."

Some image management is seen as necessary

In this context, our contacts suggested that Monsanto might be well advised to be more proactive in addressing the views of the company held by various stakeholders, including customers, NGOs, governments, farmers and other agrochemical companies. As the Brunswick executive put it: "Monsanto should do some more enlightened outreach on pesticides and GMO products. The company may think it is self-evidently right on all these fronts, but public opinion, including among its customers in the farming industry and retailers who sell its products, is trending in the opposite direction." 

More specifically, we were told that retailers see your recent stance on California's Proposition 65, as counterproductive. Retailers are aware of your decision to challenge the Proposition 65 designation of glyphosate and, for the most part, understand why you have chosen to take this course of action. While no retailer expressed frustration with how you are handling the issue, there was a view that your challenge risks painting you as a poor environmental citizen and could actually accelerate a gradual shift away from glyphosate.

A Costco executive, for example, argued: "Monsanto is making the issue worse by raising the profile of glyphosate. The more aggressive they are, the more ammunition they give the environmental campaign groups to paint them as bad citizens, a reputation that they already suffer from." 

Even within the EPA there is unease about your "scientific intransigence"

Even within the EPA, which supports your position on glyphosate, there is frustration over what some see as your stubborn resistance to taking seriously evidence that challenges your thinking. An official in the Office of Pesticide Programs (which is, admittedly, probably less convinced of the non-toxicity of glyphosate) told us: "There is growing unease in this office at what seems like scientific intransigence by Monsanto to give credibility to any evidence that doesn't fit their view. We would agree with them that such evidence is non-conclusive, but that does not mean that it is without basis."

NGOs can be expected to become more aggressive 

NGOs, in the belief that regulators have taken an overly relaxed approach to Monsanto, are expected to step up their campaigning efforts. A Senate Democratic staffer who helped negotiate reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act in 2016 ventured: "It is my view that industry across the board faces far more serious litigation risk when regulators are lax than when they are strict. There is virtually no inside way today to stop Pruitt and his political team from handing the keys to industry. That will drive NGOs to become hyper-litigious, challenging every agency policy shift, leaning way forward on launching litigation against any substances suspected of causing harm." A senior staffer for a Republican senator added: "I am not aware of a specific product that represents a serious exposure, but I am already seeing an increase in legal activism from the environmental community, and this represents a potential risk to any chemicals and/or pesticide manufacturer."

A lobbyist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental advocacy group, confirmed: "With the EPA dramatically loosening the regulatory reins and applying its mandate for risk management so narrowly, the only recourse that the NGO community will have is litigation. Our litigation team has been working overtime and is likely to continue doing so, going after both the EPA and companies." 

Continuing, he offered this example of industry practice against which the group would campaign: "Traditionally, before the EPA authorises the application of a product within a certain use and environment that could expose endangered fauna, it seeks a consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. But with the support of the current EPA leadership, organisations such as CropLife are trying to get around that traditional review process, and the EPA is acting complicit. In the farm bill that recently passed the Senate, CropLife was trying to insert language that would exempt them from exposure to lawsuits stemming from the Endangered Species Act. This would be precedent setting and would represent a major departure from the status quo. However, it is the kind of thing that the industry has been emboldened to do with the support of the administration's deregulatory agenda."

The greater risk is in the long term

There also appears to be a growing consensus that, regardless of the outcome of specific cases against RoundUp, glyphosate is likely to be slowly phased out of the market in the medium term. An executive at the National Association of Wheat Growers explained: "It appears that glyphosate use is becoming less tenable as a pesticide, and we are encouraging research into alternatives. It's possible that in 10 years time glyphosate could be phased out, but with the active acquiescence of Monsanto." 

Interestingly, there was little agreement among our contacts on why exactly they expected glyphosate products to decline in use over time - just agreement that they would. Broadly speaking, there was a belief that one way or another "the science" would eventually militate against glyphosate use. Some retailers also voiced an expectation that consumer preferences for "organic" alternatives (possibly encouraged by NGOs) would affect the market for glyphosate.

Said a senior executive at Home Depot: "There's not likely to be much short-term risk for a product like RoundUp, and the label isn't really going to matter. However, the bigger risk is in the long term. If the science around glyphosate starts to coalesce and spread beyond California, pressure could start to build on products containing glyphosate. We're going to see how things develop."`;

The agency may act this week, when it is expected to authorize booster shots for recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

The Food and Drug Administration is planning to allow Americans to receive a different Covid-19 vaccine as a booster than the one they initially received, a move that could reduce the appeal of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and provide flexibility to doctors and other vaccinators.

The government would not recommend one shot over another, and it might note that using the same vaccine as a booster when possible is preferable, people familiar with the agency’s planning said. But vaccine providers could use their discretion to offer a different brand, a freedom that state health officials have been requesting for weeks.

The approach was foreshadowed on Friday, when researchers presented the findings of a federally funded “mix and match” study to an expert committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration. The study found that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose shot who received a Moderna booster saw their antibody levels rise 76-fold in 15 days, compared with only a fourfold increase after an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson.

Federal regulators this week are aiming to greatly expand the number of Americans eligible for booster shots. The F.D.A. is expected to authorize boosters of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by Wednesday evening; it could allow the mix-and-match approach by then. The agency last month authorized booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for at least six months after the second dose.

An advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will take up the booster issue on Thursday; the agency will then issue its own recommendations. By the end of the week, tens of millions more Americans could be eligible for extra shots.

The study presented to the F.D.A.’s advisory panel last week, conducted by the National Institutes of Health, suggested that Johnson & Johnson recipients might benefit most from a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine. A shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine also raised the antibody levels of Johnson & Johnson recipients more than Johnson & Johnson did, the study found, although not as much as Moderna did. The N.I.H. researchers tested a full dose of Moderna’s vaccine for a booster shot, but regulators are also considering whether to authorize a half dose.

Experts emphasized last week that the new data was based on small groups of volunteers and short-term findings. Only antibody levels — one measure of the immune response — were calculated as part of the preliminary data, not the levels of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus, which scientists say are also an important measure of a vaccine’s success.

The study’s researchers warned against using the findings to conclude that any one combination of vaccines was better. The study “was not powered or designed to compare between groups,” said Dr. Kirsten E. Lyke, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who presented the data.

While the research on mixing and matching doses is somewhat thin, even some scientists who have strongly criticized the Biden administration’s booster policy said that providers should be given a measure of discretion as the campaign ramps up.

“If you look at the data, it certainly looks like it might be better,” Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Moderna or Pfizer boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients. “I think we should move quickly on this, because it’s already happening.”

At the meeting on Friday of the Food and Drug Administration’s expert panel, of which Dr. Offit is a member, top C.D.C. officials argued that providers needed latitude to offer different vaccines as boosters because patients might have had adverse reactions after their initial shots or presented other new concerns. Providers also might not have access to a vaccine a patient initially received, they said.

The federal government will cover the cost of a different vaccine as a booster only if the Food and Drug Administration authorizes the approach, officials said.

“I’d like to reiterate how important it is from a programmatic perspective to have a little bit of flexibility,” Dr. Melinda Wharton, a top vaccine official at the C.D.C., told the F.D.A. panel.

“From a public health perspective, there’s a clear need in some situations for individuals to receive a different vaccine,” said Dr. Amanda Cohn, another high-ranking C.D.C. official.

Both Moderna and Pfizer require two initial doses, separated by about a month. Regulators are expected to follow the same approach they took with Pfizer’s vaccine and authorize a booster of Moderna’s vaccine about six months after the second shot. Johnson & Johnson is headed for a booster shot of its vaccine at least two months after the first dose.

State health officials have been arguing for weeks that recipients of booster shots should not be strictly bound to the vaccine they initially received, for reasons such as supply, patient choice and ease of administration.

“The No. 1 thing I heard from state health secretaries was the need for permissive language around a mix-and-match approach,” said Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Maine’s top health official and the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s Covid-19 czar, said the state had a greater supply of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines than of Johnson & Johnson’s, so officials there might prefer to use them for boosters out of convenience. Others said the option of switching vaccines could streamline the administration of boosters.

“The impetus for states and local health departments was that if they were going to go out to a community site or long-term care facility and start providing boosters, it was a little inefficient to show up somewhere and say, ‘We’re just doing the people who got Pfizer,’” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “When you have a captive audience, you want to take advantage of that.”

Yet more options could lead to more confusion about booster shots, some experts have said. The Food and Drug Administration this week is expected to authorize boosters for all Johnson & Johnson recipients 18 and older. But the only Moderna recipients who are expected to become eligible for boosters are those who are at least 65 or otherwise considered at high risk, following the same eligibility requirements for recipients of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine.

Jeannette Y. Lee, a biostatistician at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and a member of the F.D.A.’s expert committee, warned on Friday that allowing people to switch from their original vaccine type could be “very, very messy in terms of the messaging.”

It remains unclear what dosage of Moderna’s vaccine might be authorized for use as a booster for recipients of other vaccines. Last week, the advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend that Moderna recipients receive a third shot of that vaccine as a booster, but at only half a dose.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, publicly suggested on Sunday that the government was headed toward granting greater leeway, at least for Johnson & Johnson recipients. “I believe there’s going to be a degree of flexibility of what a person who got the J.&J. originally can do, either with J.&J. or with the mix-and-match from other products,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Just over 15 million people have been fully vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, compared with 69.5 million for Moderna’s and 104.5 million with Pfizer-BioNTech’s.

export let DEMO_journal_article = `For the first time, machine learning has spotted mathematical connections that humans had missed. Researchers at artificial-intelligence powerhouse DeepMind, based in London, teamed up with mathematicians to tackle two separate problems — one in the theory of knots and the other in the study of symmetries. In both cases, AI techniques helped the researchers discover new patterns that could then be investigated using conventional methods.

“I was very struck at just how useful the machine-learning tools could be as a guide for intuition,” says Marc Lackenby at the University of Oxford, UK, one of the mathematicians who took part in the study. “I was not expecting to have some of my preconceptions turned on their head.”

Computer simulations and visualizations of knots and other objects have long helped mathematicians to look for patterns and develop their intuition, says Jeffrey Weeks, a mathematician based in Canton, New York, who has pioneered some of those techniques since the 1980s. But, he adds, “Getting the computer to seek out patterns takes the research process to a qualitatively different level.”

The authors say the approach, described in a paper in the 2 December issue of Nature1, could benefit other areas of maths that involve large data sets.

DeepMind, a sister company of Google, has made headlines with breakthroughs such as cracking the game Go, but its long-term focus has been scientific applications such as predicting how proteins fold.

The idea for a maths collaboration was sparked by a casual conversation in 2019 between mathematician Geordie Williamson at the University of Sydney in Australia and DeepMind’s chief executive, neuroscientist Demis Hassabis. Lackenby and a colleague at Oxford, András Juhász, both knot theorists, soon joined the project.

Initially, the work focused on identifying mathematical problems that could be attacked using DeepMind’s technology. Machine learning enables computers to feed on large data sets and make guesses, such as matching a surveillance-camera image to a known face from a database of photographs. But its answers are inherently probabilistic, and mathematical proofs require certainty.

But the team reasoned that machine learning could help to detect patterns, such as the relationship between two types of object. Mathematicians could then try to work out the precise relationship by formulating what they call a conjecture, and then attempting to write a rigorous proof that turns that statement into a certainty.

Because machine learning requires lots of data to train on, one requirement was to be able to calculate properties for large numbers of objects: in the case of knots, the team calculated several properties, called invariants, for millions of different knots.

The researchers then moved on to working out which AI technique would be most helpful for finding a pattern that linked two properties. One technique in particular, called saliency maps, turned out to be especially helpful. It is often used in computer vision to identify which parts of an image carry the most-relevant information. Saliency maps pointed to knot properties that were likely to be linked to each other, and generated a formula that seemed to be correct in all cases that could be tested. Lackenby and Juhász then provided a rigorous proof that the formula applied to a very large class of knots2.

“The fact that the authors have proven that these invariants are related, and in a remarkably direct way, shows us that there is something very fundamental that we in the field have yet to fully understand,” says Mark Brittenham, a knot theorist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln who frequently uses computational techniques. Brittenham adds that although machine learning has been used in knot theory before, the authors’ technique is novel in its ability to discover surprising connections.

Williamson focused on a separate problem, regarding symmetries. Symmetries that switch around finite sets of objects have an important role in several branches of maths, and mathematicians have long studied them using various tools, including graphs — large abstract networks linking thousands of nodes — and algebraic expressions called polynomials. For decades, researchers have suspected that it would be possible to calculate the polynomials from the networks, but guessing how to do it seemed like a hopeless task, Williamson says. “Very quickly, the graph becomes beyond human comprehension.”

With the computer’s help, he and the rest of the team noticed that it should be possible to break down the graph into smaller, more-manageable parts, one of which has the structure of a higher-dimensional cube. This gave Williamson a solid conjecture to work on for the first time.

“I was just blown away by how powerful this stuff is,” says Williamson. Once the algorithm zeroed in on a pattern, it was able to guess very precisely which graphs and polynomials came from the same symmetries. “How quickly the models were getting accuracy — that for me was just shocking,” he says. “I think I spent basically a year in the darkness just feeling the computers knew something that I didn’t.”

Whether Williamson’s conjecture will prove true is still an open question. Conjectures sometimes take a long time for the mathematical community to crack, but they can help to shape entire fields.

Throughout the project, the researchers had to tailor the AI techniques to the two different mathematical problems, says Alex Davies, a computer scientist at DeepMind. “We did not originally expect these to be the most useful techniques,” he says.

“Any area of mathematics where sufficiently large data sets can be generated could benefit from this approach,” says Juhász, adding that the techniques they demonstrated could also find applications in fields such as biology or economics.

Adam Zsolt Wagner, a mathematician at Tel Aviv University, Israel, who has used machine learning, says that the authors’ methods could prove valuable for certain kinds of problems. “Without this tool, the mathematician might waste weeks or months trying to prove a formula or theorem that would ultimately turn out to be false.” But he adds that it is unclear how broad its impact will be.

At a press conference, Davies told reporters that the project has given him a “real appreciation” for the nature of mathematical research. Learning maths at school is akin to playing scales on a piano, he added, whereas real mathematicians’ work is more like jazz improvisations.

Williamson agrees that the work highlights a more exciting aspect of maths than people normally see. “As mathematical researchers, we live in a world that is rich with intuition and imaginations,” he says. “Computers so far have served the dry side. The reason I love this work so much is that they are helping with the other side.”

“My personal guess is that computer-generated conjectures will become ever more useful in ‘filling in the details’, but will never replace human intuition and creativity,” says Weeks.
