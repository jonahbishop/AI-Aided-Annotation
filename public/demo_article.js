The agency may act this week, when it is expected to authorize booster shots for recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
The Food and Drug Administration is planning to allow Americans to receive a different Covid-19 vaccine as a booster than the one they initially received, a move that could reduce the appeal of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and provide flexibility to doctors and other vaccinators.
The government would not recommend one shot over another, and it might note that using the same vaccine as a booster when possible is preferable, people familiar with the agency’s planning said. But vaccine providers could use their discretion to offer a different brand, a freedom that state health officials have been requesting for weeks.
The approach was foreshadowed on Friday, when researchers presented the findings of a federally funded “mix and match” study to an expert committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration. The study found that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose shot who received a Moderna booster saw their antibody levels rise 76-fold in 15 days, compared with only a fourfold increase after an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson.
Federal regulators this week are aiming to greatly expand the number of Americans eligible for booster shots. The F.D.A. is expected to authorize boosters of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by Wednesday evening; it could allow the mix-and-match approach by then. The agency last month authorized booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for at least six months after the second dose.
An advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will take up the booster issue on Thursday; the agency will then issue its own recommendations. By the end of the week, tens of millions more Americans could be eligible for extra shots.
The study presented to the F.D.A.’s advisory panel last week, conducted by the National Institutes of Health, suggested that Johnson & Johnson recipients might benefit most from a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine. A shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine also raised the antibody levels of Johnson & Johnson recipients more than Johnson & Johnson did, the study found, although not as much as Moderna did. The N.I.H. researchers tested a full dose of Moderna’s vaccine for a booster shot, but regulators are also considering whether to authorize a half dose.
Experts emphasized last week that the new data was based on small groups of volunteers and short-term findings. Only antibody levels — one measure of the immune response — were calculated as part of the preliminary data, not the levels of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus, which scientists say are also an important measure of a vaccine’s success.
The study’s researchers warned against using the findings to conclude that any one combination of vaccines was better. The study “was not powered or designed to compare between groups,” said Dr. Kirsten E. Lyke, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who presented the data.
While the research on mixing and matching doses is somewhat thin, even some scientists who have strongly criticized the Biden administration’s booster policy said that providers should be given a measure of discretion as the campaign ramps up.
“If you look at the data, it certainly looks like it might be better,” Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Moderna or Pfizer boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients. “I think we should move quickly on this, because it’s already happening.”
At the meeting on Friday of the Food and Drug Administration’s expert panel, of which Dr. Offit is a member, top C.D.C. officials argued that providers needed latitude to offer different vaccines as boosters because patients might have had adverse reactions after their initial shots or presented other new concerns. Providers also might not have access to a vaccine a patient initially received, they said.
The federal government will cover the cost of a different vaccine as a booster only if the Food and Drug Administration authorizes the approach, officials said.
“I’d like to reiterate how important it is from a programmatic perspective to have a little bit of flexibility,” Dr. Melinda Wharton, a top vaccine official at the C.D.C., told the F.D.A. panel.
“From a public health perspective, there’s a clear need in some situations for individuals to receive a different vaccine,” said Dr. Amanda Cohn, another high-ranking C.D.C. official.
Both Moderna and Pfizer require two initial doses, separated by about a month. Regulators are expected to follow the same approach they took with Pfizer’s vaccine and authorize a booster of Moderna’s vaccine about six months after the second shot. Johnson & Johnson is headed for a booster shot of its vaccine at least two months after the first dose.
State health officials have been arguing for weeks that recipients of booster shots should not be strictly bound to the vaccine they initially received, for reasons such as supply, patient choice and ease of administration.
“The No. 1 thing I heard from state health secretaries was the need for permissive language around a mix-and-match approach,” said Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Maine’s top health official and the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s Covid-19 czar, said the state had a greater supply of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines than of Johnson & Johnson’s, so officials there might prefer to use them for boosters out of convenience. Others said the option of switching vaccines could streamline the administration of boosters.
“The impetus for states and local health departments was that if they were going to go out to a community site or long-term care facility and start providing boosters, it was a little inefficient to show up somewhere and say, ‘We’re just doing the people who got Pfizer,’” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “When you have a captive audience, you want to take advantage of that.”
Yet more options could lead to more confusion about booster shots, some experts have said. The Food and Drug Administration this week is expected to authorize boosters for all Johnson & Johnson recipients 18 and older. But the only Moderna recipients who are expected to become eligible for boosters are those who are at least 65 or otherwise considered at high risk, following the same eligibility requirements for recipients of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine.
Jeannette Y. Lee, a biostatistician at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and a member of the F.D.A.’s expert committee, warned on Friday that allowing people to switch from their original vaccine type could be “very, very messy in terms of the messaging.”
It remains unclear what dosage of Moderna’s vaccine might be authorized for use as a booster for recipients of other vaccines. Last week, the advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend that Moderna recipients receive a third shot of that vaccine as a booster, but at only half a dose.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, publicly suggested on Sunday that the government was headed toward granting greater leeway, at least for Johnson & Johnson recipients. “I believe there’s going to be a degree of flexibility of what a person who got the J.&J. originally can do, either with J.&J. or with the mix-and-match from other products,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”
Just over 15 million people have been fully vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, compared with 69.5 million for Moderna’s and 104.5 million with Pfizer-BioNTech’s.

export let DEMO_journal_article = `In this chapter, we describe how to compactify heterotic string theory on orbifolds (for further
    introductions, see e.g. [49, 50]). We start with a detailed review of the geometrical construction of
    toroidal orbifolds with Abelian point groups. Afterwards, we examine the heterotic string theory
    in its bosonic formulation in order to fix the notation and to prepare for the main part of this
    chapter, where some explicit ZN and ZN ×ZM orbifolds are constructed. We conclude this chapter
    with a discussion on Yukawa couplings and string selection rules. Some parts of this chapter have
    been published [42, 43, 47].
    2.1 Geometry
    The Torus
    A six-dimensional torus T
    6
    is chosen by specifying a six-dimensional lattice
    Γ = {nαeα, nα ∈ Z, sum over α = 1, . . . , 6} , (2.1)
    spanned by the basis vectors eα, α = 1, . . . , 6. Then the torus is defined as the quotient space
    
    T
    6 ≡ R6
    /Γ , (2.2)
    i.e. points of R6 differing by some lattice vector of Γ are identified. In this context, we will also
    call Γ the torus lattice. We choose it to be the root lattice of a semisimple Lie algebra. The basis
    vectors eα of Γ can be chosen to be the simple roots of the Lie algebra, or some other basis of the
    root lattice. For a 2d example Γ = SU(3), see figure (2.1). From the basis vectors of Γ we define
    the torus metric g in the absence of a nontrivial background by
    
    gij ≡ ei
    · ej . (2.3)
    In the case of eα being simple roots, it coincides, except for a possible normalization, with the
    Cartan matrix of the semisimple Lie algebra defining the lattice.

    Figure 2.1: Two-dimensional lattice Γ = SU(3). The grey region represents the area of the torus
    R2/Γ and is called the fundamental domain. Note the shorthand: Γ = SU(3) means that Γ can
    be spanned by the simple roots e1 and e2 of SU(3).
    13
    
    14 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    The Point Group
    In order to specify an orbifold, we need to choose a (finite) symmetry of the torus lattice Γ. This
    symmetry group is called the point group, denoted by P. In the following, we restrict ourselves to
    the Abelian case, i.e. to cyclic groups ZN or products thereof, such that the action of the point
    group P on the lattice can be visualized as discrete rotations mapping the lattice to itself. For
    example, in the case of a two-dimensional SU(3) torus lattice (see figure (2.1)), we can identify
    different symmetries that map the lattice to itself: Z2, Z3 and Z6. In order to be a symmetry of
    some six-dimensional lattice Γ, the point group P has to be a subgroup of the group of rotations
    in 6d, i.e. a subgroup of SO(6) ≃ SU(4). Furthermore, P sits in the Cartan subalgebra of SU(4),
    since we want the point group to be Abelian. The rank of SU(4) is three, i.e. the number of
    Cartan generators is three. It is convenient to choose them as
    
    J12, J34 and J56 , (2.4)
    where Jij generates a rotation in the plane spanned by the orthonormal basis vectors ˆei and ˆej .
    In this basis an element of P can be written as
    
    exp
    2πi
    v
    1J12 + v
    2J34 + v
    3J56 , (2.5)
    
    where v
    i
    specifies the rotation angle in the i-th plane, e.g. v
    
    1 = 1/3 is a rotation about 120◦
    in the first plane spanned by ˆe1 , ˆe2. Using the three Cartan generators J12, J34 and J56, we
    can have at most three independent ZN factors. Later, in section 2.3, we will see that requiring
    N = 1 supersymmetry in 4d amounts to choosing point groups P being in the Cartan subalgebra
    of SU(3) ⊂ SU(4), which allow for at most two independent ZN factors. Therefore, in the case
    of an Abelian point group, P is either ZN or ZN × ZM (for some specific values of N and M, N
    being a multiple of M, see e.g. [51, 52]).
    Since P ⊂ SU(3), it is convenient to rewrite the six-dimensional space R6
    
    in a complex basis as
    
    C3
    , i.e. as three orthogonal complex planes. We can naturally choose the i-th complex plane to
    be spanned by ˆe2i−1 and ˆe2i
    
    . In this basis, elements of P are complex 3 × 3 matrices that are
    
    diagonalized simultaneously. Then, the generator θ of a ZN point group reads
    
    θ = diag(e
    2πiv
    1
    , e2πiv
    2
    , e2πiv
    3
    ) . (2.6)
    
    We define the twist vector as
    
    v ≡ (0, v1
    , v2
    , v3
    ) , (2.7)
    
    where the first entry is included for later use. The order of the generator θ
    
    N = 1 translates to the
    
    twist vector as Nvi ∈ Z, for i = 1, 2, 3. Thus, the point group P is given by
    
    P =
    
    θ
    k
    | k = 0, . . . , N − 1
    
    . (2.8)
    
    In order for θ to be an element of SU(3) (such that det(θ) = 1) the condition v
    1 + v
    2 + v
    3 ∈ Z
    has to be imposed on the twist vector. It is convenient to choose the twist vector such that this
    condition reads
    
    v
    1 + v
    2 + v
    3 = 0 . (2.9)
    In the case of ZN × ZM the two generators θ and ω are associated to two twist vectors v1 and v2
    satisfying
    
    v
    1
    1 + v
    2
    1 + v
    3
    1 = 0 and v
    1
    2 + v
    2
    2 + v
    3
    2 = 0 , (2.10)
    
    which are of order N and M, respectively.
    Factorized and Non-Factorized Lattices
    In the complex basis of C3
    
    , where the elements of the (Abelian) point group are diagonal 3 × 3
    
    matrices, the underlying lattice Γ can be aligned differently inside C3
    
    . We distinguish two cases.
    In the first one, the six-dimensional lattice can be written as the product of three two-dimensional

    lattices and each of these two-dimensional sublattices lies inside one of the three complex planes,
    e.g. Γ = SU(3)×SU(3)×SU(3). This lattice is called factorized. In this case the i-th exponent v
    i of
    eqn. (2.6) can easily be visualized as a rotation in the i-th two-dimensional sublattice. Otherwise,
    the lattice is said to be non-factorized. In this case, each basis vector of Γ is specified by three
    in general non-zero complex coordinates, e.g. Γ = E6. It is important to note that one has to
    specify these coordinates in order to distinguish between factorized and non-factorized lattices.
    For example, in the case of a Z2 × Z2 point group of a lattice Γ = SU(3) × SU(2)4 one has to
    specify the orientation of the SU(3) sublattice inside C3
    
    in order to see whether Γ is factorized or
    
    not, see section 2.5.4 for more details on this example.
    The Space Group
    Having specified a torus lattice Γ and a point group P, it is convenient to define now the space
    group S as the semidirect product of the point group P and the translations associated to Γ. In
    detail, an element g of S can be written as
    
    g = (θ, nαeα) , (2.11)
    where θ ∈ P and nαeα ∈ Γ, summing over α. Then, by definition, g acts on a point z ∈ C3 as
    follows
    
    gz = (θ, nαeα) z = θz + nαeα , (2.12)
    see figure (2.2) for an example. Furthermore, the product of two elements of the space group
    g = (θ1, nαeα) and h = (θ2, mαeα) reads
    
    g h = (θ1, nαeα) (θ2, mαeα) = (θ1θ2, nαeα + θ1(mαeα)) , (2.13)
    reflecting the properties of the semidirect product of P and Γ. The inverse of g = (θ, nαeα) is
    easily found to be
    
    g
    −1 =
    θ
    −1
    , −θ
    −1
    (nαeα)
    
    . (2.14)
    
    It is important to notice that in general two elements of S do not commute,
    
    hg ̸= gh , (2.15)
    
    i.e. although P is Abelian, the space group S is not.
    The Orbifold
    Now, we can define the six-dimensional (toroidal) orbifold as the quotient space
    
    O ≡ T
    6
    /P = C
    3
    /S , (2.16)

    Figure 2.3: The fundamental domain of the two-dimensional Z3 orbifold (light grey region) is one
    third of the fundamental domain of the two-torus SU(3) (grey region).
    i.e. points of C3 are identified in O if they differ by the action of some element of the space
    group: z ∼ gz with g ∈ S [12, 13]. In order to identify a fundamental domain of the orbifold1
    ,
    
    it is convenient to start from a fundamental domain of the torus T
    
    6 and identify points that are
    mapped to each other under the action of P. For a two-dimensional example see figure (2.3).
    Fixed Points
    In the definition of the orbifold O, the space group S does not act freely on C3
    
    . This means
    
    that there are so-called fixed points zf ∈ C3
    
    , i.e. points that are invariant under the action of a
    
    nontrivial element g = (θ, nαeα) ∈ S
    gzf = zf ⇔ zf
    
    is a fixed point of g , (2.17)
    
    see figure (2.4) for an example. If the rotation θ = diag(e
    2πiv
    1
    , e2πiv
    2
    , e2πiv
    3
    ) acts trivially in one
    of three complex directions, equation (2.17) will be solved by a whole set of fixed points, denoted
    as fixed torus. For example, if g = (θ, 0) with v
    
    1 = 0 and v
    2
    , v3 ̸= 0, equation (2.17) is solved by
    
    zf = (z
    1
    f
    , 0, 0), where z
    1
    f ∈ C arbitrary, yielding a fixed torus located at the origin of the second
    and third complex planes. In general, given a nontrivial element g ∈ S, it is easy to find the
    associated fixed point (or torus) from equation (2.17) as
    zf = (1 − θ)
    −1
    nαeα . (2.18)
    Therefore, we will also denote the fixed point as g, i.e. by its associated space group element.
    Fixed points are curvature singularities. This can be seen from the local holonomy groups at the

    various points of an orbifold. In general, the holonomy group is trivial everywhere indicating flat
    space (i.e. no curvature). However, at the fixed points we find a non-trivial holonomy group: ZN
    or a subgroup thereof. For a two-dimensional example with Z3 holonomy see figure (2.5). Since a
    non-trivial holonomy group is related to a non-vanishing curvature (cf. page 344ff of [53]), there
    are curvature singularities at the fixed points of the orbifold. In chapter 5 it is shown how these
    singularities can be resolved in the context of Z3 orbifolds.
    1Note that the fundamental domain can be represented in various ways and is therefore not unique.

    of the torus. Note that due to the orbifold this path gives a closed loop around the fixed point at
    the origin. Furthermore, the Z3 action identifies vector (2) and (3). Thus, vector (1) is rotated
    by 120◦
    to vector (3), illustrating the non-trivial Z3 holonomy group at the origin.
    Inequivalent Fixed Points
    We say that two fixed points (space group elements) g1 and g2 are equivalent if they are related
    by conjugation, i.e.
    
    g1 ∼ g2 ⇔ g1 = hg2h
    −1
    for some h ∈ S . (2.19)
    In the case of h being a pure translation h = (1, mαeα), this can easily be interpreted as two fixed
    points g1 and g2 = (θ, nαeα) that are identified on the torus. We show this in detail:
    g1 = hg2h
    −1 = (1, mαeα) (θ, nαeα) (1, −mαeα) = (θ,(1 − θ)mαeα + nαeα) (2.20)
    
    and therefore the coordinates zf2 and zf1 of the fixed points g2 and g1 read
    
    zf2 = (1 − θ)
    −1
    nαeα (2.21)
    
    zf1 = (1 − θ)
    −1
    [(1 − θ)mαeα + nαeα] = zf2 + mαeα , (2.22)
    respectively. Since zf1 = zf2 + mαeα and mαeα is clearly from the torus lattice Γ, these fixed
    points are identified on the torus zf1 ∼ zf2
    
    . In the case of a general element h = (φ, mαeα) this
    
    result generalizes to
    
    zf1 = φzf2 + mαeα = hzf2
    
    . (2.23)
    This leads us to the conclusion that equivalent fixed points are identified on the orbifold O and
    the inequivalent fixed points are given by the conjugacy classes [g] of S. See figure (2.6) for a
    two-dimensional Z6 example.

    18 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    The Untwisted Sector and Twisted Sectors
    We group all inequivalent space group elements (and hence the associated fixed points if they
    exist) according to their point group elements into either the untwisted sector or the twisted
    sectors. For example, in the case of a ZN × ZM orbifold with generators θ and ω, some element
    g =
    θ
    k1 ω
    k2
    , nαeα
    
    ∈ S with 0 ≤ k1 < N and 0 ≤ k2 < M is said to belong to
    
    • the untwisted sector U if k1 = k2 = 0. Elements of the untwisted sector are neither associated
    to fixed points nor to fixed tori.
    • the twisted sector T(k1,k2)
    
    if k1 ̸= 0 or k2 ̸= 0. In the case of twisted sectors, an element g
    
    corresponds to a fixed point or fixed torus.
    The untwisted sector U and the twisted sectors T(k) are analogously defined in the case of a ZN
    orbifold.
    Continuous Lattice Deformations
    For the definition of the orbifold, eqn. (2.16), it was crucial that the underlying torus lattice Γ
    obeys the symmetry of the point group P. This condition strongly constrains the choice of allowed
    lattices. However, a given lattice Γ always allows for some continuous deformations while keeping
    its point group symmetry: at least the overall size is a free parameter of the lattice which does
    not affect the action of the point group. In order to see this in more detail we consider a specific
    example first. In the case of a two-dimensional Z2 orbifold, the basis vectors e1 and e2 of the
    (deformed) lattice Γ = SU(2)2
    
    can be parameterized by three (real) variables R1, R2 and α12 as
    e1 = R1 and e2 = R2e
    iα12
    , (2.24)
    see figure (2.7). For R1 ̸= 0, R2 ̸= 0 and α12 ̸= nπ, n ∈ Z, the vectors e1 and e2 are linear
    independent and allow for the Z2 point group generated by θ = e
    πi
    . Note that for special values
    the two-dimensional Z2 orbifold has an enhanced symmetry [54,55], e.g. for R1 = R2 and α12 =
    2π
    3
    the orbifold can be visualized as a tetrahedron with its four fixed points being located at the four
    corners and consequently the symmetry of the orbifold is S4. In the general case, some torus
    lattice Γ allows for continuous deformations as long as its torus metric g is invariant under the
    action of the point group P. Let us discuss this in detail. We start with some general torus lattice
    Γ(α) spanned by six (real) basis vectors ei(α), where α indicates some coordinates that describe
    all deformations of the lattice. These coordinates can for example be associated to some radii
    or angles. We assume that for α = 0 the lattice Γ(0) is the root lattice of some semisimple Lie
    algebra which is suitable for the point group P. Obviously, the torus metric depends on the α’s
    gij (α) = ei(α) · ej (α) , (2.25)

    . The fundamental domain of the torus (grey region)
    is reduced on the orbifold to one half (light grey region). Furthermore, there are four inequivalent
    fixed points.

    and coincides with the Cartan matrix for α = 0. Under the action of the point group generator θ
    the vectors ei(α) transform as ei(α) 7→ θei(α) = ˆθji(α)ej (α). Furthermore, it is easy to see (using
    θ
    T
    θ = 1) that the torus metric is invariant under the action of the twist
    
    g(α)
    θ
    7→ ˆθ
    T
    (α)g(α)
    ˆθ(α) = g(α) . (2.26)
    Now, we can distinguish two cases. First of all, if ˆθji(α) ∈/ Z, the point group is not a symmetry
    of the lattice. Secondly, if ˆθji(α) ∈ Z is constant, then it is clearly independent of the continuous
    parameter α. This means that the twist θ maps the lattice to itself for any value of α. In this
    case ˆθ can be identified as the so-called Coxeter element [56] of the undeformed lattice Γ(0).2
    
    Consequently, starting with a torus lattice Γ(0) and a (constant) Coxeter element ˆθ, we can de-
    termine the allowed lattice deformations, corresponding to some coordinates α
    
    ′
    , out of all possible
    
    deformations α by demanding invariance of the torus metric

    As an example, we will discuss the deformations of the Z3 orbifold later in section 2.5.1.
    Factorizable and Non-Factorizable Lattices
    In the context of the last section, we say that an orbifold has a factorizable lattice if it can be
    deformed continuously to a factorized form while keeping its point group symmetry. Otherwise,
    the lattice is called non-factorizable3
    .
    2.2 The Heterotic String
    To set the notation, we start with a brief review of the heterotic string theory [10, 11] (for an
    
    introduction, see e.g. chapter 7 of [59]). It is a theory of closed strings propagating in ten-
    dimensional space-time. The string is described by maps Xμ(τ, σ) that embed the two-dimensional
    
    world sheet, equipped with coordinates (τ, σ), into the 10d target space M10. Closed strings are
    subject to boundary conditions, i.e.
    Xμ
    (τ, σ + π) = Xμ
    
    (τ, σ) μ = 0, . . . , 9 (2.28)
    for the bosonic degrees of freedom Xμ, see figure (2.8). Since the heterotic string is oriented,
    left-movers (τ + σ) and right-movers (τ − σ) can be treated separately, e.g.
    
    Xμ
    (τ, σ) = X
    μ
    L
    (τ + σ) + X
    μ
    R
    (τ − σ) . (2.29)
    
    The Bosonic Construction
    In the so-called bosonic construction of the heterotic string theory, the theory is described by
    two parts. On the one hand, the right-movers consist of the 10 dimensional superstring with
    bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom X
    μ
    R
    (τ − σ) and Ψμ
    R
    (τ − σ), respectively. In the context
    of two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) on the world sheet, these degrees of freedom are
    related by N = 1 (local) supersymmetry. On the other hand, the left-movers are described by
    the 26 dimensional bosonic string coordinates X
    μ
    L
    (τ + σ) and XI
    L
    (τ + σ), where μ = 0, . . . , 9 and
    I = 1, . . . , 16. All bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are subject to boundary conditions
    analog to equation (2.28), where for the fermionic degrees Ψμ
    R
    they can be either periodic (Ramond
    2The Coxeter element is an inner automorphism of the Lie lattice Γ(0) and can be expressed by a series of Weyl
    reflections. It can be extended to the so-called generalized Coxeter element by including outer automorphisms
    (automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram). More details can be found in e.g. [57] and [58].
    3Note that using this nomenclature a non-factorized lattice can be factorizable.

    - R) or antiperiodic (Neveu-Schwarz - NS). In order to match the number of dimensions of left-
    and right-movers to 10 dimensions, 16 bosonic left-moving degrees of freedom XI
    
    L
    are compactified
    
    on a 16-torus
    
    XI
    L ∼ XI
    L + πλI with λ ∈ Λ , (2.30)
    where Λ is a 16-dimensional torus lattice. By modular invariance of the partition function, this
    16-torus is required to be defined by an even and self-dual lattice Λ. In 16 dimensions there are
    only two choices4
    
    : the weight lattices of
    
    E8 × E8 or Spin(32)/Z2 . (2.31)
    Some details about these lattices can be found in appendix C.1. As a consequence of this toroidal
    
    compactification, the 16 dimensional (internal) momentum p is quantized: p ∈ Λ. Since the mo-
    menta p are elements of the weight lattice Λ of E8 × E8 or Spin(32)/Z2, they have an additional
    
    interpretation as weights. In other words, strings with non-trivial internal momenta p will trans-
    form non-trivially under gauge transformations - they form representations corresponding to their
    
    weights p. Thus, the 16 bosonic coordinates XI
    L
    give rise to a gauge theory and are therefore called
    
    the gauge degrees of freedom.
    Quantization in the Light-Cone Gauge
    It is convenient to choose light-cone coordinates for the remaining ten dimensions. For the bosonic
    degrees of freedom Xμ they read
    X± ≡
    1
    √
    2
    X0 ± X9
    
    , (2.32)
    
    together with Xi
    
    for i = 1, . . . , 8 being the transversal coordinates. Then we can fix the gauge such
    
    that only the Xi are physical. In this gauge only a transversal SO(8) rotational group of the ten-
    dimensional Lorentz group SO(9, 1) is manifest. The general solutions to the equations of motion
    
    for the string are given in terms of mode expansions for Xi
    L/R, XI
    L
    and Ψi
    R as functions of (τ, σ),
    being periodic in σ. The coefficients in these mode expansions are named oscillators5
    . After
    quantization, they become creation and annihilation operators depending on their frequencies
    being negative or positive, respectively. For example, oscillators of the bosonic coordinates Xi
    L/R
    
    are denoted by  ̃α
    i
    n and α
    i
    n
    , with n being the frequency. After quantization of the heterotic string
    
    in the light-cone gauge one obtains mass equations for right- and left-movers

    5The name “oscillators” for the coefficients in the mode expansion shall remind us of the harmonic oscillator,
    since they also fulfill the algebra of creation and annihilation operators after quantization.

    respectively. The constants −
    1
    2
    and −1 in these mass equations are called zero-point energies (or
    normal-ordering constants, as they arise from the normal-ordering of the oscillators). Furthermore,
    oscillator excitations originating from the right-moving fermionic degrees of freedom Ψi
    R were
    encoded in an SO(8) weight vector q. This vector is also named the right-moving momentum (for
    details on this procedure, called “bosonization”, see for example chapters 13,14 of [60]). The GSO
    projection [61] restricts q to lie either in the vector weight lattice (for Ψi
    
    R from the NS sector) or
    
    spinor weight lattice (for Ψi
    
    R from the R sector) of the transversal SO(8). Moreover, the oscillator
    
    number N ̃ of the left-mover is defined as
    N ̃ =
    X∞
    n=1
    α ̃−n · α ̃n , (2.34)
    
    where the scalar product sums over the transverse modes  ̃α
    i
    n and over  ̃α
    I
    n
    . The right-moving
    
    oscillator number N is defined analogously as N =
    P∞
    n=1 α−n · αn. Using the commutators
    
    [ ̃α

    i
    m|0⟩R =  ̃α

    m|0⟩L = 0 for m > 0 , (2.36)
    one sees that the oscillator numbers N ̃ and N essentially count the number of oscillators  ̃α−n
    and α−n (weighted with their frequency n) acting on the ground state, e.g. the eigenvalue of N ̃
    for  ̃α
    i
    −1
    |0⟩L is 1. Furthermore, in order to ensure that no point in the σ direction of a string is
    preferred, we have to impose the so-called level-matching condition
    
    M2
    R = M2
    L
    , (2.37)
    
    which removes the tachyons (i.e. states with negative M2
    
    ) from the spectrum. Finally, since
    left- and right-movers are independent, a physical state can be written as a tensor product of a
    left-moving and a right-moving state
    
    |q⟩R ⊗ |p⟩L , (2.38)
    
    subject to possible oscillator excitations, for example with  ̃α−1 for the left-mover.
    Representations of the Little Group
    In general, in D-dimensional space-time with Lorentz symmetry SO(D − 1, 1) states transform
    on-shell in representations of the so-called little group. For massive states this is SO(D − 1),
    whereas for massless ones it is SO(D − 2). Therefore, in our case with D = 10, we can identify
    in the massless case the transversal SO(8) with the little group SO(8). On the other hand, in the
    massive case representations of the transversal group SO(8) have to combine to representations of
    the little group SO(9). From here we see that everything which is related to the eight-dimensional
    transversal coordinates may contribute to the transformation property of a string under Lorentz
    transformations, i.e. the right-moving momenta q and the transversal oscillators  ̃α
    i
    n define the
    
    string’s representation of the little group SO(8) (or SO(9)).
    The Massless Spectrum
    The solutions to the equation for massless right-movers (2.33a) are characterized by q
    2 = 1 (note
    that N has integral eigenvalues, thus N > 0 yields massive states). Since q is restricted to lie either
    in the vector or in the spinor weight lattice of the transversal SO(8), the right-movers’ momenta
    q are given by the weight vectors of either the vector or the spinor representation:
    • The vector representation 8v of SO(8) is given by q = (±1, 0, 0, 0) and the corresponding
    state describes a vector boson in 10 dimensional space-time.
    
    21

    ) (with an even
    number of plus signs) and the corresponding state describes a fermion in 10 dimensional
    space-time6
    .
    
    On the other hand, the solutions to the equation for massless left-movers (2.33b) are given by
    either p
    2 = 2 and N ̃ = 0 or p
    
    2 = 0 and N ̃ = 1. In the first case of p
    
    2 = 2, the 16 dimensional
    internal momenta p are the roots of E8 × E8 or SO(32), see appendix C.1. In the second case, the
    N ̃ = 1 oscillator states  ̃α
    K
    −1
    |0⟩L, where K = i, I, are found to be massless. Building the tensor
    product of massless right- and left-movers yields the massless spectrum of the heterotic string:

    −1
    |0⟩L N = 1 SUGRA multiplet (i = 1, . . . , 8) (2.41)
    First, we discuss the gauge quantum numbers of these states. The 480 + 16 = 496 states in
    eqns. (2.39) and (2.40) transform in the adjoint representation 248 + 248 of E8 × E8 or 496 of
    SO(32). The states of eqn. (2.41) are gauge singlets. Secondly, we discuss the transformation
    properties under Lorentz transformation. Note that the oscillators  ̃α
    I
    
    −1 with I = 1, . . . , 16 trans-
    form trivially under SO(8). However, the oscillators  ̃α
    
    i
    −1 with i = 1, . . . , 8 transform in the 8v
    representation of SO(8). Thus, we have to decompose the SO(8) tensor products in eqn. (2.41) of
    weights q and oscillators  ̃α−1 into irreducible representations. We begin with the first case of q
    being bosonic
    
    8v × 8v = 1 + 28 + 35v (2.42)
    giving rise to 64 bosons: the dilaton Φ (1), the antisymmetric two-form Bij (28) and the graviton
    gij (35v). Secondly, in the case of q being fermionic, we find
    
    8s × 8v = 8c + 56c (2.43)
    corresponding to the dilatino (8c) and the gravitino (56c), in total 64 fermions. This shows that for
    the massless level we have the same amount of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom for both,
    the vector multiplet of E8 × E8 or SO(32) given in eqns. (2.39) and (2.40) and the supergravity
    multiplet of eqn. (2.41), reflecting N = 1 supersymmetry in 10 dimensions.
    10d Anomaly Cancelation
    The ten-dimensional heterotic string theories for both E8 × E8 and SO(32) yield anomaly free
    field theories. Anomalies in 10d can be understood in terms of hexagon diagrams, i.e. one–
    loop diagrams involving six external legs which can be gravitons and gauge bosons. The purely
    gravitational anomaly “gravity6
    
    ” (i.e. with 6 external gravitons) vanishes because the contribution
    from the dilatino (8c) and the gravitino (56c) are exactly compensated by the 496 gauginos of
    E8 × E8 or SO(32). The mixed “gauge − gauge − gravity4
    
    ” anomaly is more involved. It can
    be expressed by the 10d anomaly polynomial I12, which does not seem to vanish at first sight.
    However, it factorizes for E8 × E8 and SO(32) as I12 ∼ X4 · X8, where [24, 62]7
    
    X4 = tr R2 − tr(iF)

    2.3. COMPACTIFICATION 23
    2.3 Compactification
    
    In order to make contact with the Standard Model of particle physics or with its minimal super-
    symmetric extension (the MSSM), we have to hide six spatial dimensions. In the context of the
    
    heterotic string, this is done by a compactification on a six-dimensional internal space, i.e. we
    choose the ten-dimensional target space M10 as
    
    M10 = M3,1 × M6 . (2.46)
    Shrinking the compact dimensions of M6 to unobservably small sizes leaves us with an effective
    
    theory in four-dimensional Minkowski space-time M3,1. Important properties of the effective the-
    ory (including the amount of supersymmetry, the gauge group and the massless matter spectrum)
    
    are directly related to the geometry and topology of the internal space. The question of low energy
    N = 1 supersymmetry in 4d severely restricts possible choices for the internal space. Therefore,
    we will start our discussion with this topic. It will be explained why important examples for these
    special types of compact spaces are the Calabi-Yau manifold and the orbifold (with an additional
    condition on the point group).
    6d Compact Spaces with N = 1
    By compactifying on a six-dimensional space M6 we clearly distinguish between our 4d Minkowski
    
    space-time and the six internal coordinates. Consequently, the transversal SO(8) of the ten-
    dimensional Lorentz group will break. The specific form of this breaking depends on the geometry
    
    of the internal space and is, as we will see, directly related to the amount of supersymmetry in
    4d. Generically, the breaking is of the form
    
    SO(8) → SO(2) × SO(6) (2.47)
    
    which is isomorphic to
    
    U(1) × SU(4) . (2.48)
    The U(1) is associated to the uncompactified directions of the 4d Minkowski space-time and can
    therefore be interpreted as the four-dimensional helicity. Furthermore, from the 4d low energy
    point-of-view, the SU(4) is rather an internal symmetry than a symmetry of space-time. As we
    will see in the following, 4d bosons and fermions transform differently with respect to this SU(4).
    
    Hence, we identify it as an R-symmetry (i.e. a symmetry that does not commute with super-
    symmetry). Hence, we analyze the decomposition of the two eight-dimensional representations
    
    of SO(8) that describe ten-dimensional bosons and fermions into representations of SU(4). For
    details see appendix C.2. The decomposition reads
    
    8v → 60 + 11 + 1−1 (2.49)
    8s → 41/2 +  ̄4−1/2 , (2.50)
    where the subscripts state the U(1) charges, i.e. the helicities. The remnants of the bosonic 8v
    describe six real scalars (60 with spin 0 in 4d) and one vector field (of both helicities 11 + 1−1,
    where the state 1−1 is the CPT-conjugate of 11 with opposite helicity and thus not independent).
    In the case of the fermionic 8s the two four-plets 41/2 +  ̄4−1/2 are identified as four fermions of
    spin 1/2 in 4d. Using these decompositions for the 10d vector multiplet of E8 × E8 or SO(32) in
    eqn. (2.39) and (2.40), we can interpret these fields as the particle content of one N = 4 vector
    multiplet in 4d space-time8
    
    . However, in order to verify N = 4 we have to count the number of 4d
    gravitinos. Therefore, we decompose the 10d gravitino eqn. (2.43) into representations of SU(4)
    56c → 43/2 + 41/2 + 4−1/2 + 4−3/2 + 201/2 + 20−1/2 . (2.51)
    8The N = 4 vector multiplet in 4d contains six real scalars, one vector field and four spin 1/2 fermions.
    
    23
    
    24 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    The two representations 43/2+4−3/2 correspond to the two helicity states of four spin 3/2 fermions,
    the 4d gravitinos. They transform under the internal SU(4) R-symmetry in a four-dimensional
    representation. Thus, from the 4d perspective we have four gravitini and consequently N = 4
    supersymmetry. Since in the case of N = 4 all fields transform in the adjoint representation, this
    theory is non-chiral and therefore cannot incorporate the chiral particle spectrum of the Standard
    Model. Taking a different perspective will help us to find compact spaces allowing for N = 1
    supersymmetry in four dimensions. The internal SO(6) symmetry assumed at the beginning of
    this section is the symmetry of a flat space M6, in other words a symmetry of a space with trivial
    holonomy. We denote the parameter (field) of (local) SUSY transformations by ε, being a spinor
    in 10d. Due to the compactification it decomposes into spinorial representations of the internal
    SO(6), being the 4 and 4. The 4-plet is the complex conjugate of the 4-plet with opposite chirality
    and therefore does not describe independent fields. We denote the field associated to the 4-plet by
    ηi with i = 1, . . . , 4. Since the (flat) internal space has trivial holonomy, these four fields transform
    as singlets of the trivial holonomy group
    
    4 → 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 . (2.52)
    In other words, all four spinors ηi are covariantly constant (i.e. ∇mηi = 0). The number of
    covariantly constant spinors on the internal space gives the number of unbroken supersymmetry
    charges Qi
    . Thus, we find four unbroken supersymmetry charges Qi
    
    , i = 1 . . . , 4, of N = 4
    
    supersymmetry in four dimensions9
    
    . Finally, one unbroken supersymmetry Q1 needs exactly
    one covariantly constant spinor η1. The other three spinors η2, η3 and η4 of the 4-plet should
    transform non-trivially. Then, the three associated supersymmetries are broken. This is achieved
    for example by compact spaces M6 with SU(3) holonomy [63], in which case the 4-plet decomposes
    in the desired way
    
    4 → 3 + 1 , (2.53)
    and we have a compact space that admits one covariantly constant spinor. These spaces are called
    Calabi-Yau manifolds. Another possibility to admit only one covariantly constant spinor is generic
    to orbifold compactifications. The generator θ of the (Abelian) point group P is represented by
    the twist vector v (see eqn. (2.6)). Its action on a spinor with weight q yields in general a phase
    θ : |q⟩ 7→ exp(−2πiq · v)|q⟩ (2.54)
    
    as will be discussed later in equation (2.65). We demand exactly one invariant spinor (one param-
    eter η1 of N = 1 supersymmetry). We choose the corresponding weight to be
    
    q =
    
    1
    2
    ,
    1
    2
    ,
    1
    2
    ,
    1
    2
    
    . (2.55)
    Note that if q is invariant, the weight −q corresponding to the CPT-conjugate of η1 will be
    invariant, too. By fixing our choice for q we have to impose the following condition on the twist
    vector
    
    v1 + v2 + v3 = 0 , (2.56)
    such that the transformation in eqn. (2.54) is trivial for eqn. (2.55), but non-trivial for the other
    spinor components. Since additionally v
    
    0 = 0 we see that the point group P is a subgroup of
    
    SU(3) ⊂ SU(4).
    Remark: Right-Moving Momenta in Index Notation
    Sometimes, it is convenient to use an index notation for the right-moving momenta q. This
    notation is also used in the literature quite frequently (e.g. [59, 64]). Thus, we will review it
    briefly, but specialize to the cases we will need later. Consider the bosonic states |q⟩R with
    
    9Beside covariantly constant spinors, this additionally requires vanishing H-flux, a constant dilaton and a van-
    ishing variation of the gauginos, as we will assume.
    
    24
    
    2.4. STRINGS ON ORBIFOLDS 25
    weights q = (0, ±1, 0, 0), corresponding to the six compactified dimensions of M6. To each q we
    can associate either a holomorphic index i or an anti-holomorphic index  ̄i. In detail, this reads
    
    |q(i)⟩R ⇔ |i⟩R and |q( ̄i)
    
    ⟩R ⇔ | ̄i⟩R (2.57)
    
    with i = 1, 2, 3 and  ̄i =  ̄1,  ̄2,  ̄3, and
    
    q(1) = (0, −1, 0, 0) , q( ̄1) = (0, 1, 0, 0) ,
    q(2) = (0, 0, −1, 0) , q( ̄2) = (0, 0, 1, 0) ,
    q(3) = (0, 0, 0, −1) , q( ̄3) = (0, 0, 0, 1) .
    
    (2.58)
    Thus, an anti-holomorphic index  ̄i transforms in the complex conjugate representation of the
    holomorphic index i, compare to eqn. (2.54).
    2.4 Strings on Orbifolds
    Now we are prepared to compactify heterotic strings on orbifolds [12,13]. In other words, we choose
    the internal part of the ten-dimensional target space M10 as the quotient space of an orbifold
    
    M6 = C
    3
    /S . (2.59)
    We restrict ourselves to toroidal, Abelian and symmetric orbifolds. Examples for asymmetric
    
    orbifolds, where right- and left-moving degrees of freedom are compactified on different six-
    dimensional spaces, are considered in [16, 65]. Furthermore, examples of non-Abelian orbifolds
    
    having non-Abelian point groups like A4 can be found in e.g. [66]. We start our discussion with
    the investigation of boundary conditions for closed strings on orbifolds. In this section, the main
    equations which are relevant for the computation of the massless spectrum are highlighted by
    boxes.
    Boundary Conditions
    
    On the orbifold there are more boundary conditions that lead to closed strings than on flat ten-
    dimensional Minkowski space, i.e. there are new closed strings that are closed only up to the
    
    action of some space group element. These new boundary conditions read in the case of the
    bosonic degrees of freedom Xi
    
    (τ, σ + π) = (gX)
    i
    (τ, σ) with i = 1, . . . , 6, or equivalently in the
    
    complex basis
    
    Z
    i
    (τ, σ + π) = (g Z)
    i
    (τ, σ) i = 1, 2, 3 . (2.60)
    g ∈ S is called the constructing element of the string. It is the element of the space group that
    maps the one end of the string to the other one, yielding a closed string on the quotient space of
    the orbifold, see figure (2.9). In the case of g = (1, 0) the boundary condition eqn. (2.60) reduces
    to the boundary condition of the uncompactified heterotic string eqn. (2.28). According to the
    grouping into untwisted and twisted sectors this string belongs to the untwisted sector. On the
    other hand, strings with non-trivial constructing elements belong to some twisted sectors and are
    thus called twisted strings.
    Twisted Mode Expansion
    Since the orbifold is a flat space, except for the singularities at the fixed points, we can write
    down the general solutions to the equations of motion in terms of simple mode expansions, like in
    the case of the uncompactified heterotic string, see e.g. [67, 68]. First, we choose a constructing
    element g =
    θ
    k1 ω
    k2
    , nαeα
    
    ∈ S. The corresponding twisted string is subject to the so-called local
    
    twist vg ≡ k1v1 + k2v2
    
    10. From the bosonic mode expansion on can infer that the center of mass
    of a twisted string is attached to the fixed point (or fixed torus) associated to g. The twisted
    10Analogously in the case of ZN orbifolds: if g =
    θ
    k, nαeα
    
    ∈ S then the local twist reads vg ≡ kv.

    string cannot move apart; it is localized at the fixed point. This implies that the components of
    the internal momentum corresponding to the directions of the fixed point vanish. In the case of
    a fixed torus only those components of the internal momentum can be non-zero that point into
    the directions of the torus. Furthermore, due to the non-trivial twist vg, the mode expansions
    of a twisted string contain twisted oscillators, i.e. oscillators with fractional frequencies: for
    example  ̃α−1/3 for the bosonic coordinates on a Z3 orbifold. As these oscillators originate from
    the mode expansions of the bosonic coordinates Z
    
    i or their complex conjugates Z
     ̄i ≡ (Z
    i
    )
    ∗
    , they
    are equipped with holomorphic indices i = 1, 2, 3 or antiholomorphic ones  ̄i =  ̄1,  ̄2,  ̄3, respectively.
    Figuratively speaking, an oscillator with index i or  ̄i acts in the i-th complex plane. In general,
    the twisted (bosonic) oscillators read  ̃α
    i
    n−ωi
    or  ̃α
     ̄i
    n+ωi
    , where n ∈ Z and
    
    ωi = (vg)i mod 1 such that 0 ≤ ωi < 1 . (2.61)
    Note that ωi will appear quite frequently in the following. As usual, an oscillator with negative
    frequency corresponds to a creation operator and an oscillator with positive frequency to an
    annihilation operator. As the zero-point energies of the left- or right-moving sectors depend on
    the respective oscillator contents, the presence of twisted oscillators modifies them. However, it
    turns out that the shift δc in the zero-point energies is the same in both sectors and reads
    
    δc =
    1
    2
    X
    3
    i=1
    wi(1 − wi) . (2.62)
    Furthermore, due to the presence of twisted oscillators in the mode expansion of the fermionic
    degrees of freedom Ψi
    
    R, the right-moving momenta q are shifted by the local twist vg. Consequently,
    
    the equation for massless right-movers reads
    (q + vg)
    2
    2
    −
    1
    2
    + δc = 0 . (2.63)
    
    As before, q is restricted to be from the vector or from the spinor weight lattice of SO(8). Further-
    more, we define the shifted right-moving momentum qsh = q +vg. However, we cannot write down
    
    the mass equation for the left-movers now. The reason being that the left-moving sector of the
    compactified heterotic string has to be changed more than just by the six-dimensional orbifold in
    order to lead to a consistent theory in 4d. We will discuss this in detail later, after we considered
    the transformation properties of right-movers and twisted oscillators.
    Transformation of Right-Movers and Oscillators under the Space Group
    On the orbifold, right-moving states transform under the action of the space group. In order to
    see this, we express a given state |qsh⟩R by its corresponding vertex operator (see e.g. appendix C
    of [34])
    
    e
    −2qsh·H , (2.64)
    26
    
    2.4. STRINGS ON ORBIFOLDS 27
    where Hi
    , i = 1, . . . , 4 are the four bosonized coordinates. Under the action of some space group
    element h ∈ S, they are shifted according to H 7→ H + πvh. Consequently the right-moving state
    |qsh⟩R acquires a phase
    
    |qsh⟩R
    h
    7→ e
    −2πiqsh·vh |qsh⟩R . (2.65)
    Also the bosonic oscillators transform under the action of the space group. Since we will need this
    only for the left-moving oscillators  ̃α
    i
    n−ωi
    and  ̃α
     ̄i
    n+ωi
    , we will restrict to this case in the following.
    As a given oscillator carries either a holomorphic index i or an antiholomorphic one  ̄i, it transforms
    according to the rotation v
    i
    h
    in the i-th complex plane, i.e.
    α ̃
    i
    n−ωi
    h
    7→ e

    h α ̃

    .
    Now, we can turn back to the question of the orbifolded left-movers.
    Gauge Embedding
    Modular invariance of the theory (see section 2.4.3) forbids the orbifold action to be restricted only
    to the six-dimensional compact space M6. It is necessary to extend the action of the orbifold to
    the gauge degrees of freedom XI
    L
    of the left-moving sector. Thus, the space group S is not enough
    to define a consistent heterotic orbifold model. We need to define a group, the so-called gauge
    twisting group denoted by G, that acts on the 16 gauge degrees of freedom XI
    L
    , i.e. XL
    h
    7→ h XL
    with h ∈ G and points that are mapped to each other are identified XL ∼ hXL. Therefore, one
    can understand G as a group that defines a 16-dimensional orbifold on the internal coordinates
    XI
    L
    . In general, G corresponds to an automorphism of the Lie algebra of E8 × E8 or Spin(32)/Z2.
    However, it is known that any (inner) automorphism can be realized as a shift [13]
    
    XL
    h
    7→ XL + πV , (2.67)
    which acts freely. Consequently, the 16-dimensional orbifold in the gauge degrees of freedom has
    neither fixed points nor fixed tori. The space group S (defining the orbifold of the six-dimensional
    space) and the gauge twisting group G (defining the one of the gauge degrees of freedom) are
    forced to act simultaneously due to modular invariance. In other words, G is an embedding of the
    space group S acting in the gauge degrees of freedom
    
    S ,→ G . (2.68)
    Explicitly, the simultaneous action of S and G on the 3 complex and 16 real coordinates reads
    
    Z
    h
    7→ θZ and XL
    h
    7→ XL + πV , (2.69)
    for a transformation under the twist h = (θ, 0; V, 0). Since the shift V is the embedding of the
    twist θ, it needs to be of the same order N: since θ
    
    N = 1 is the identity on M6, NV must also
    act trivially on the gauge degrees of freedom. We will discuss this in detail later. We name the
    full, consistent group that acts on both, the three complex-dimensional space M6 and the gauge
    degrees of freedom XI
    L
    , as the orbifold group O. An element of O, in the case of a ZN × ZM point
    
    group, is of the form
    h =
    θ
    t1 ω
    t2
    , mαeα; t1V1 + t2V2, mαAα
    
    ∈ O , (2.70)
    
    and acts on the coordinates according to
    Z
    h
    7→ θ
    t1 ω
    t2Z + mαeα (2.71)
    
    XL
    h
    7→ XL + π (t1V1 + t2V2 + mαAα) . (2.72)
    
    27
    
    28 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    That is, a twist θ
    t1 ω
    t2
    is accompanied by a shift t1V1 + t2V2 and a torus lattice vector mαeα by
    mαAα. In detail, whenever we go along a torus direction eα the gauge degrees of freedom are
    shifted by Aα. This induces a phase e
    
    2πip·Aα which depends on the momentum p, i.e.11
    
    e
    2ip·XL
    eα
    7→ e
    2ip·(XL+πAα) = e
    2πip·Aα e
    2ip·XL ⇒ |p⟩L
    eα
    7→ e
    2πip·Aα |p⟩L . (2.73)
    Hence, the shifts Aα are called Wilson lines [13,14]. Analogously to eqn. (2.73), we see that under
    the action of some general orbifold group element h of eqn. (2.70) a left-mover with momentum p
    acquires a phase
    
    e
    2πip·(t1V1+t2V2+mαAα)
    
    . (2.74)
    
    Twisted Mode Expansion II
    Now, we have defined two equivalence relations on the gauge degrees of freedom. First of all, the
    coordinates XL are compactified on the 16-torus Λ: XL ∼ XL + πp for p ∈ Λ. Secondly, the gauge
    twisting group G defines an orbifold of the 16 gauge degrees of freedom, namely
    
    XL ∼ XL + π (k1V1 + k2V2 + nαAα) . (2.75)
    The combination of both yields new boundary conditions for strings being closed in the gauge
    degrees of freedom
    
    XL(τ + σ + π) = g XL(τ + σ) + πp (2.76)
    = XL(τ + σ) + π (p + k1V1 + k2V2 + nαAα) , (2.77)
    i.e. they are only closed up to the action of the element g = (k1V1 + k2V2, nαAα) ∈ G and a lattice
    shift with p ∈ Λ. We define
    
    Vg ≡ k1V1 + k2V2 + nαAα and psh ≡ p + Vg (2.78)
    as the local shift Vg associated to g and the shifted momentum psh, respectively. The mode
    expansion for a twisted string, XL(τ + σ) = x + psh(τ + σ) + oscillators, gives the general solution
    of the equation of motion, which is compatible with the boundary condition eqn. (2.76). There,
    we see that psh defines the internal momentum of this twisted state. Being from the gauge degrees
    of freedom, psh has the additional interpretation as the weight defining the representation under
    gauge transformations. Having defined a twisted state |psh⟩L using the boundary conditions g =
    (k1V1 + k2V2, nαAα) ∈ G, we can transform it along the direction h = (t1V1 + t2V2, mαAα) ∈ G.
    From the vertex operator e
    
    2ipsh·XL , we see that it acquires a phase
    |psh⟩L
    h
    7→ e
    2πipsh·Vh |psh⟩L . (2.79)
    Furthermore, the equation for massless left-movers from a twisted sector with constructing element
    g reads
    
    (p + Vg)
    2
    2
    + N ̃ − 1 + δc = 0 , (2.80)
    where Vg is the local shift and δc as defined in eqn. (2.62). Note that the oscillator number
    N ̃ now sums over the six twisted oscillators of the six compactified dimensions. Therefore, it
    can have fractional eigenvalues, e.g. the eigenvalue of N ̃ for  ̃α
    i
    −1/3
    is 1/3. For computational
    reasons, we want to know which frequencies n − ωi or −n + ωi with n ∈ N of twisted oscillators
    can in principle appear in the massless spectrum. Since N ̃ ≥ 0 and δc > 0 for some non-trivial
    constructing element g ∈ S, we know that the solutions to eqn. (2.80) are constrained by
    
    (p + Vg)
    2 < 2 and N ̃ ≤ 1 − δc . (2.81)
    Consequently, only combinations of the twisted oscillators (having negative frequencies)
    
    α ̃
    i
    −ωi
    and  ̃α
     ̄i
    −1+ωi
    
    (2.82)
    
    for i = 1, 2, 3 and  ̄i =  ̄1,  ̄2,  ̄3 can potentially yield massless excited left-movers.
    11A state |p⟩L with momentum p corresponds to a vertex operator e
    
    2ip·XL , see e.g. appendix C of [34].

    2.4. STRINGS ON ORBIFOLDS 29
    Transformation Phase
    From the previous discussions we know the transformation properties of each part of a twisted
    state under the action of the Orbifold group. Here, we want to summarize these results and
    complete them by introducing the so-called vacuum phase. We start with a state |qsh⟩R ⊗ α ̃|psh⟩L
    that describes a closed string with constructing element g ∈ S and is possibly excited by some
    oscillators  ̃α. Under the action of some element h ∈ S, the state transforms with a phase
    
    |qsh⟩R ⊗ α ̃|psh⟩L
    h
    7→ Φ|qsh⟩R ⊗ α ̃|psh⟩L . (2.83)
    
    The transformation phase Φ reads in detail
    Φ ≡ e
    2πi [psh·Vh−R·vh] Φvac . (2.84)
    
    The last term of this equation, the vacuum phase Φvac, is given by12
    
    Φvac = e
    2πi [− 1
    2
    (Vg·Vh−vg·vh)]
    
    , (2.85)
    
    compare to appendix A.5 and appendix A of [44]. Furthermore, in order to summarize the trans-
    formation properties of qsh and of the oscillators we have introduced the so-called R–charge. It is
    
    defined as
    
    R
    i ≡ q
    i
    sh − N ̃i + N ̃ ∗i
    
    . (2.86)
    
    N ̃i and N ̃ ∗i
    
    , i = 0, . . . , 3, are integer oscillator numbers, counting the number of oscillators  ̃α
    i
    
    and  ̃α
     ̄i acting on the ground state |p⟩L, respectively. In detail, they are given by splitting the
    eigenvalues of the number operator N ̃ according to
    N ̃ = ωiN ̃i +  ̄ωiN ̃ ∗i
    
    , (2.87)
    
    where ωi = (vg)i mod 1 and  ̄ωi = −(vg)i mod 1 such that 0 ≤ ωi
    , ω ̄i < 1.
    
    2.4.1 Physical States
    Since the massless string is completely specified by its constructing element g, its left- and right–
    moving shifted momenta psh and qsh and possible oscillator excitations  ̃α, we write down a first
    ansatz for a physical state from the Hilbert space Hg on an orbifold
    
    |phys⟩ ∼ |qsh⟩R ⊗ α ̃|psh⟩L ⊗ |g⟩ . (2.88)
    Up to now it is not guaranteed that a physical state is actually compatible with the orbifold. To
    ensure this compatibility, invariance of |phys⟩ under the action of all elements of the orbifold group
    O ⊂ S ⊗ G must be imposed. To do so, the boundary condition for twisted strings eqn. (2.60) is
    multiplied by an arbitrary element h ∈ S:
    
    h Z(τ, σ + π) = h g Z(τ, σ) (2.89)
    ⇔ h Z(τ, σ + π) = h g h−1 h Z(τ, σ) (2.90)
    For keeping the expressions simple, we choose shifts and Wilson lines such that the vacuum phase
    Φvac = 1 vanishes. Now, we can distinguish two cases:
    12More details about this extra phase can be found for example at the end of section 3 in reference [16] or in
    section 5 of reference [69].
    
    29
    
    30 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    Commuting Elements: [h, g] = 0
    First, let us consider the transformation property of |phys⟩ with respect to a commuting element
    h. Note that geometrically a commuting element can be interpreted either as being associated to
    the same fixed point as g or as acting in directions orthogonal to the ones in which g acts, see
    appendix A.4. In the case of commuting elements, the boundary condition eqn. (2.90) reads
    h Z(τ, σ + π) = g h Z(τ, σ) , (2.91)
    
    i.e., the constructing element g is invariant under the action of h,
    
    |g⟩
    h→ |h g h−1
    
    ⟩ = |g⟩ . (2.92)
    hZ closes under the same constructing element g as Z. Thus, both give rise to the same Hilbert
    space Hg
    h→ Hhgh−1 = Hg. Furthermore, on the orbifold space C
    
    3/S the string coordinates hZ
    and Z are identified. Thus, hZ and Z describe the same physical state. In summary, provided a
    constructing element g, we have shown that for commuting elements h, h Z and Z give rise to the
    same physical states from the same Hilbert space. Since h has to act as the identity on |phys⟩,
    the following condition follows using eqns. (2.88), (2.84) and (2.92):
    
    psh · Vh − R · vh
    
    != 0 mod 1 . (2.93)
    Note that in the general case the contribution from the vacuum phase eqn. (2.85) has to be included
    here. If the state |phys⟩ does not fulfill the invariance condition eqn. (2.93) it is not “compatible”
    with the orbifold space and hence needs to be removed from the spectrum: non-invariant states
    are projected out. In other words, the total vertex operator of the state with boundary condition
    g has to be single-valued when transported along h if h is an allowed loop [h, g] = 0.
    Non–Commuting Elements: [h, g] ̸= 0
    Next, considering a non–commuting element h eqn. (2.90) yields
    
    h Z(τ, σ + π) =
    h g h−1
    
    h Z(τ, σ) , (2.94)
    
    i.e., the constructing element g is not invariant under the action of h,
    
    |g⟩
    h−→ |h g h−1
    
    ⟩ ̸= |g⟩ . (2.95)
    In the upstairs picture, i.e. in the covering space C3 of the orbifold C3/S, one has different Hilbert
    spaces for the states with boundary conditions g and h g h−1
    
    . In this picture, eqn. (2.95) says that
    h maps states from a given Hilbert space Hg onto a different Hilbert space Hh g h−1 . Subsequent
    application of h then leads to the sequence 13
    
    Hg
    h−→ Hh g h−1
    
    h−→ Hh2 g h−2
    
    h−→ Hh3 g h−3
    h
    −→ . . . . (2.96)
    The crucial point is now that on the orbifold h Z and Z are identified. This means that, on the
    orbifold, the different Hilbert spaces Hhn g h−n of the upstairs picture are to be combined into a
    single orbifold Hilbert space H[g]
    
    . Invariant states are then linear combinations of states from
    all Hhn g h−n . Such linear combinations do, in general, involve relative phase factors (often called
    gamma–phase γ). So, the new ansatz for a physical state reads:
    
    |phys⟩ ∼ X

    e
    −2πi n γ |qsh⟩R ⊗ α ̃|psh⟩L ⊗ |h

    −2πi n γ |h

    , (2.97)
    13Note that in all Hhngh−n the left–moving momenta psh of equivalent states are identical. The same holds for
    qsh and R.

    Since h has to act as the identity on |phys⟩, the following condition follows using eqns. (2.84),
    (2.97) and (2.98) for non–commuting elements:
    psh · Vh − R · vh + γ
    
    != 0 mod 1 . (2.99)
    Notice that γ depends on h. Thus, we can always choose γ(h) such that this condition is satisfied14
    .
    In principle, these steps have to be repeated for all non–commuting elements in order to ensure
    invariance of the physical state under the action of the whole orbifold group O ⊂ S ⊗ G. The
    result for |phys⟩ reads
    
    |phys⟩ = |qsh⟩R ⊗ α ̃|psh⟩L ⊗

    where the summation over h is such that each term |h g h−1
    
    ⟩ appears only once. Note that the
    summation over h can be understood as a summation over all representatives of the conjugacy
    class of g.
    Example
    To illustrate the construction of physical states, let us consider an example in the twisted sector
    of a two-dimensional Z3 orbifold. In the SU(3) lattice spanned by e1 and e2, there are three
    inequivalent fixed points associated to the constructing elements g1 = (θ, 0), g2 = (θ, e1) and
    g3 = (θ, e1 + e2), or analogously gi = (θ, ai e1 + bi e2) for i = 1, 2, 3 with ai = (0, 1, 1) and
    bi = (0, 0, 1) (compare to figure (2.4)). Then, using h = (1, ne1 + me2), the geometrical part of a
    physical state can be written as
    X
    n,m
    e
    −2πi(n+m)γ
    
    (θ,(n + m + ai) e1 + (2m − n + bi) e2)
    
    . (2.101)
    Since the action of θ has order 3, the only possible θ–eigenvalues of eqn. (2.101) have γ = 0, ±
    1
    3
    .
    In the case of γ = 0, eqn. (2.101) is invariant under all rotations and translations for all three gi
    .
    
    However, if γ = ±
    1
    3
    , the eigenvalue of eqn. (2.101) depends on gi
    
    : for the fixed point at the origin
    
    associated to g1, eqn. (2.101) is invariant under θ, but has an eigenvalue
    
    e
    2πi γ (k+l) under (1, ke1 + le2) . (2.102)
    Similarly, for the fixed points away from the origin, corresponding to gi (i ̸= 1), eqn. (2.101) picks
    up a phase
    
    e
    −2πi γ (ai+bi) under θ , (2.103)
    see figure 2.10. It can be shown that for physical states γ ̸= 0 is only possible in the presence of
    a Wilson line in the e1 and e2 directions.
    In Practice only Commuting Elements: [h, g] = 0
    As we have seen in the last sections, it is necessary to enforce invariance of physical states under
    the action of the whole orbifold group O. For strings from the untwisted sector this condition
    14In this sense, building linear combinations and computing the γ phase is not a projection condition. Note that
    γ(h) is well–defined: if h1gh−1
    1 = h2gh−1
    2
    then γ(h1) = γ(h2).

    g2 = (θ, e1) is invariant under (θ, e1), but transforms into equivalent fixed points outside the
    fundamental domain under h = (θ, 0). To form an eigenstate of (θ, 0), one needs to build linear
    combinations of the equivalent fixed points. The corresponding eigenvalues can be 1, e±2πi/3
    .
    cannot be weakened: all elements h ∈ S commute with the constructing element (1, 0) of the
    untwisted sector and hence we must project on the h-invariant subspace of the untwisted sector.
    However, in the case of twisted strings we can weaken this condition. The first step, to project
    out states not invariant under commuting elements, remains unchanged. The second step, to
    build linear combinations involving the gamma-phase γ can be omitted. The gamma-phases are
    not needed for the computation of the massless spectrum. It is always possible to choose the
    gamma-phase γ(h) for a given state such that this state remains invariant under h. From this
    perspective, there is no projection involved in building linear combinations. Furthermore, we will
    
    show later in section 2.7 that also for the computation of the allowed Yukawa couplings the gamma-
    phases are redundant. In summary, the procedure to compute the massless spectrum reads: for
    
    each inequivalent constructing element g we first have to solve the equations for massless strings
    (eqns. (2.63) and (2.80)). Next, we have to identify the commuting elements h (for example by
    the method presented in appendix A.4) and finally project out the non-invariant states (according
    to eqn. (2.93)).
    2.4.2 Conditions on the Gauge Embeddings
    The following considerations will lead us to some consistency conditions on the gauge embeddings,
    i.e. the shift V and the Wilson lines Aα. We will derive them explicitly for the case of ZN orbifolds,
    but just state the results for the ZN × ZM case, which can be derived analogously.
    The Order of the Shift
    Consider a ZN orbifold with θ being the order N generator of the point group. Now, act N times
    with an orbifold group element g = (θ, 0; V, 0) on the 3 complex + 16 real bosonic coordinates Z
    and XL.
    
    Z

    7→ θ
    N Z ,
    XL

    N
    7→ XL + πNV .
    
    (2.104)
    
    We know that θ
    
    N = 1 is the identity on the three orbifolded coordinates Z. We furthermore
    
    see that θ
    N is embedded as NV into the gauge degrees of freedom XL. Consequently, we have
    to demand that the identity operation θ
    
    N is embedded as a “trivial” element acting on the XL.
    Since, the gauge degrees of freedom are already compactified on the lattice Λ, see eqn. (2.30), we
    find that this trivial element can be a lattice vector, that is
    
    NV ∈ Λ . (2.105)
    32
    
    2.4. STRINGS ON ORBIFOLDS 33
    In summary, the twist θ of order N is transmitted to a shift V of the same order. In the case of a
    ZN × ZM point group, the shifts V1 and V2 have to be of order N and M, respectively.
    The Order of the Wilson Line
    This time we act with g = (θ, eα; V, Aα) on the 3+16 bosonic degrees of freedom Z and XL.
    However, in general we do not do this N times, but only Nα times, where Nα is determined by
    the equation
    
    θ
    Nα−1
    eα + θ
    Nα−2
    eα + . . . + eα
    | {z }
    
    Nα terms
    
    = 0 , (2.106)
    and N is a multiple of Nα. Knowing the value of Nα, we can transform the bosonic coordinates
    with g
    Nα as follows
    Z
    g
    Nα
    7→ θ
    Nα Z + θ

    g
    Nα
    7→ XL + πNαV + πNαAα .
    
    (2.107)
    
    We denote the space group part of g as gs ≡ (θ, eα). From eqn. (2.107) we see that g
    Nα
    s =
    θ
    Nα , 0
    
    
    does not contain any lattice vector eα of the torus. Therefore, g
    Nα
    s
    should be embedded into the
    gauge degrees of freedom as a pure shift without Wilson lines, i.e. as NαV . This is achieved by
    demanding that the Wilson line Aα is of order Nα, i.e.
    
    NαAα ∈ Λ , (2.108)
    no summation over the index α. Hence, the name discrete Wilson line. In general, the Wilson
    lines Aα are not independent on the orbifold. In detail, a Wilson line Aα is associated to a torus
    lattice vector eα. On the orbifold however, some torus vectors are no longer inequivalent, i.e. they
    are identified. Thus, the associated Wilson lines of equivalent torus vectors have to be identified,
    too. This leads us to the condition
    
    θeα = nαeα ⇒ Aα = nαAα + λ , (2.109)
    where λ ∈ Λ and the sum runs over α = 1, . . . , 6, such that the Wilson lines associated to eα
    and θeα are the same. We can derive this condition more explicitly by transforming the bosonic
    coordinates with g = (θ, eα; V, Aα) twice

    7→ θ

    XL
    g
    2
    7→ XL + π2V + π2Aα .
    
    (2.110)
    From this, we get the same conclusion: the Wilson lines associated to the torus lattice vectors
    
    eα and θeα must be the same. We give two short examples. First, consider the case of a two-
    dimensional Z3 orbifold on an SU(3) lattice. In this case, following eqn. (2.109), the torus lattice
    
    vectors e1 and e2 are related by the twist and the associated Wilson lines A1 and A2 have to be
    equal [14], i.e.
    
    θe1 = e2 ⇒ A1 = A2 , (2.111)
    
    up to a lattice vector which conventionally is set to zero. Furthermore, from θ
    2
    e1 + θe1 + e1 = 0
    
    we find that the Wilson line must be of order 3
    
    3A1 = 3A2 ∈ Λ , (2.112)
    as explained in eqns. (2.106) and (2.107). The second example concerns the six-dimensional Z6-II
    orbifold on an SU(6) × SU(2) lattice. In reference [50] it is shown that this lattice allows for two
    independent Wilson lines: one of order 6 and one of order 2.
    
    A1 = A2 = A3 = A4 = A5 with 6A1 ∈ Λ and (2.113)
    A6 with 2A6 ∈ Λ . (2.114)
    33
    
    34 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    The conditions on the shift and Wilson lines derived here together with further conditions arising
    from modular invariance will be summarized later in section 2.4.3, for both types of orbifolds ZN
    and ZN × ZM.
    Remark: Rotation Embedding and Continuous Wilson Lines
    As a remark, we briefly discuss the possibility to embed the twist θ as a rotation Θ into the gauge
    degrees of freedom XL [27], i.e.
    
    XL
    θ
    7→ ΘXL . (2.115)
    Following the steps of eqn. (2.104) in this case leads to the obvious requirement that also Θ is of
    order N, that is
    
    Θ
    N = 1 . (2.116)
    Furthermore, there are important consequences in the case of nontrivial Wilson lines. Thus, we
    analyze the action of an orbifold group element containing a torus shift and its associated Wilson
    line, for example take g = (θ, eα; Θ, Aα) and take the N′
    
    -th power of it, i.e. g
    N′
    . As we will see,
    
    it is important to distinguish between two cases for N′
    :
    
    1. In the first case, the Wilson line is invariant under Θ, i.e. ΘAα = Aα. It will turn out that
    setting N′ = Nα using the definition of eqn. (2.106) is useful in this case.
    2. In the second case, the Wilson line transforms non-trivially under Θ, i.e. ΘAα ̸= Aα and it
    is convenient to set N′ = N.
    Now, we transform the 3+16 bosonic degrees of freedom with g
    N′
    . Restricting to the gauge degrees
    
    of freedom XL, this yields
    XL
    g
    N′
    7→ ΘN′
    XL + ΘN′−1Aα + ΘN′−2Aα + . . . + Aα
    | {z }
    
    N′ terms
    
    .
    
    (2.117)
    
    Again, we discuss the two cases separately:
    1. Since ΘAα = Aα, we see that ΘNα−1Aα + . . . + Aα = NαAα and the Wilson line must be
    of order Nα. Compare to eqn. (2.107).
    2. In this case ΘN−1Aα + ΘN−2Aα . . . + Aα = 0 vanishes automatically, since Θ is a rotation
    of order N. Thus, there is no restriction on the length of the Wilson line. Hence, the name
    continuous Wilson line.
    Continuous Wilson lines are known to break the rank of the gauge group. This rank reduction
    by continuous Wilson lines can be interpreted alternatively as a Higgs mechanism induced by an
    untwisted field obtaining a vev [18, 27, 70–73].
    2.4.3 Modular Invariance
    Modular invariance of one–loop amplitudes imposes strong conditions on the shifts and Wilson
    lines. In ZN orbifolds, the order N shift V and the twist v must fulfill [13, 74]:
    
    N
    V
    2 − v
    2
    
    = 0 mod 2 . (2.118)
    
    For ZN ×ZM orbifolds with Wilson lines, modular invariance, including some consistency require-
    ments as discussed in appendix A.7, yields the conditions [44]
    
    N

    15
    2.4.4 The Untwisted Sector
    After the general discussion on strings on orbifolds, we can now turn to more explicit calculations.
    First, we will analyze the untwisted sector in this section. Strings in the untwisted sector fulfill
    the trivial boundary conditions of eqn. (2.28), i.e. their constructing elements are g = (1, 0).
    Consequently, we know the solutions to the equations for massless untwisted strings. They are
    given by the 10d spectrum of the heterotic string: the 10d SUGRA multiplet and the 10d vector
    
    multiplets corresponding to the 16+480 generators of the 10d gauge group, as discussed in sec-
    tion 2.2. However, these states will in general not be invariant under the action of the orbifold. As
    
    explained in section 2.4.1, we have to project out non-invariant states in order to find the physical
    states of the orbifold model.
    The SUGRA multiplet and Moduli
    The 10d supergravity multiplet specified in eqn. (2.41) is a gauge singlet (with p = 0). Hence,
    its compactification only depends on the twist, but is independent of the choices for shifts and
    Wilson lines16. If the twist θ (or θ and ω in the case of a ZN × ZM point group) fulfills the N = 1
    condition, eqn. (2.9), it is easy to see that the following components of the 10d supergravity
    multiplet, eqn. (2.41), are invariant
    |q⟩R ⊗ α ̃

    ,

    or q = (±1, 0, 0, 0) . (2.120)
    As usual, we can read off the transformation properties under 4d Lorentz transformation from
    the right-mover. The combination of the fermionic right-moving momentum q and the oscillator
    α ̃
    μ
    −1
    transforming as a 4d space-time vector boson gives rise to one spin 3/2 fermion plus its CPT
    conjugate, the gravitino. On the other hand, combining the bosonic q with this oscillator yields
    a spin 2 boson plus its CPT conjugate, the graviton. Thus, in summary, these states correspond
    to the 4d SUGRA multiplet for N = 1. Beside the 4d supergravity multiplet, there are further
    invariant components of its 10d version. Here, we restrict to the bosonic states and use the index
    notation of section 2.2 for the right-moving momenta q. First, we have to discuss briefly how
    right-movers |i⟩R or | ̄i⟩R with holomorphic or anti-holomorphic indices transform under the action
    of the orbifold group. From eqn. (2.58) we can see that an index i,  ̄i transforms with a phase
    
    e
    −2πiq(i)·v = e
    2πiv
    i
    for i and e
    −2πiq( ̄i)
    ·v = e
    −2πiv
    i
    for  ̄i , (2.121)
    under the action of the twist θ, respectively. Now, we can summarize all “internal” components
    of the 10d supergravity multiplet
    Ni ̄j ≡ |i⟩R ⊗ α ̃
     ̄j
    −1
    |0⟩L and Nij ≡ |i⟩R ⊗ α ̃
    j
    −1
    |0⟩L , (2.122)
    
    with i, j = 1, 2, 3 and  ̄j =  ̄1,  ̄2,  ̄3. The states N ̄ij and N ̄i ̄j are the CPT partners of the above-
    mentioned ones and are therefore not listed. Independently of the choice of the point group P,
    
    we see from the transformation properties given in eqns. (2.66) and (2.121) that N1 ̄1
    , N2 ̄2 and
    N3 ̄3 are invariant under the action of P. Furthermore, a state Nij can only be invariant if the
    twist θ contains at least one rotation by 180◦
    
    in one of the three complex dimensions, i.e. vi =
    1
    2
    for some i. Depending on the specific choice of θ further components of (2.122) can be invariant
    for some combinations of i, j = 1, 2, 3 and  ̄j =  ̄1,  ̄2,  ̄3, see e.g. [75, 76]. These states are moduli
    and describe metric variations of the type δgi ̄j and δgij , respectively. The states Ni ̄j are real
    15In the case of two different Z2 Wilson lines we find that (2.119f) can be relaxed, i.e. gcd(Nα, Nβ) can be
    replaced by Nα Nβ = 4, provided there exists no g ∈ P with the property g eα ̸= eα but g eβ = eβ. Imposing
    the weaker condition leads, as we find, to anomaly-free spectra.
    16Note that in the untwisted sector the vacuum phase is trivial, as vg = 0 and Vg = 0.
    
    35
    
    36 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    (1, 1) moduli describing variations of the K ̈ahler structure and the Nij are complex (1, 2) moduli
    corresponding to variations of the complex structure. It is important to note that the number of
    untwisted moduli is a topological quantity and therefore does not depend on the torus lattice Γ,
    but only on the point group P. On the other hand the interpretation of a given modulus as some

    The states of eqn. (2.40) correspond to the 16 Cartan generators. In detail, they read
    
    |q⟩R ⊗ α ̃
    I
    −1
    |0⟩L . (2.123)
    Their left-moving momenta are trivial p = 0. However they are not gauge singlets, as they are
    excited by oscillators  ̃α
    I
    −1
    in the 16 gauge degrees of freedom. It is important to note that these
    left-movers are unaffected by shifts in the gauge degrees of freedom, i.e. by shifts with the shift
    vector V or with Wilson lines Aα. Therefore, the left-movers are invariant under the action of the
    orbifold group. On the other hand, the right-movers acquire phases such that
    
    |q⟩R ⊗ α ̃
    I
    −1
    |0⟩L
    θ
    → e
    −2πiq·v
    |q⟩R ⊗ α ̃
    I
    −1
    |0⟩L . (2.124)
    Thus, only those 10d states are invariant on the orbifold that have q = (−1, 0, 0, 0), q = (−

    ) or the CPT conjugates thereof, i.e. −q. This yields 4d vector bosons and 4d Weyl spinors
    and consequently vector multiplets in 4d. The other states have to be projected out. In summary,
    we find 16 4d vector multiplets associated to the 16 Cartan generators. The rank of the 4d gauge
    group cannot be reduced by shift embeddings; it is always 16.
    480 generators of E8 × E8 or SO(32)
    The 480 states associated to the charged generators of E8×E8 or SO(32) transform under a general
    orbifold transformation h ∈ O with a phase
    |q⟩R ⊗ |p⟩L → e
    
    2πi(p·Vh−q·vh)
    
    |q⟩R ⊗ |p⟩L . (2.125)
    The destiny of these states depend on their right-movers. For a given state the right-mover can
    be either invariant under the action of the orbifold group, or not. In the first case, q · vh = 0,
    the invariant right-mover carries a momentum q = (−1, 0, 0, 0), q = (−

    ) or a CPT
    conjugate thereof, as in the case of the Cartans. But what does this imply for the left-mover? In
    order for the whole state to be invariant, the left-moving momentum has to satisfy the condition
    p · Vh = 0 ⇔ p · V = 0 and p · Aα = 0 for α = 1, . . . , 6 . (2.126)
    The set of invariant states in this category gives rise to the 4d gauge group. Their left-moving
    momenta p are the roots of the corresponding adjoint representation. In the second case, q ·vh ̸= 0,
    the right-mover carries a momentum q = (0, −1, 0, 0) or q = (−
    1

    ) (or a CPT conjugate
    thereof). From the 4d perspective, such a right-mover corresponds to a scalar or to a Weyl spinor
    giving rise to a chiral multiplet in 4d. If a given state with q · vh ̸= 0 does not fulfill the projection
    condition eqn. (2.125)
    
    p · Vh − q · vh
    
    != 0 (2.127)
    it is not invariant and hence has to be removed from the 4d spectrum. The set of invariant
    states gives rise to matter fields, transforming in representations specified by their weights p.
    In summary, the untwisted sector of the 4d orbifold model contains the SUGRA multiplet, the
    moduli associated to the geometry of the internal orbifold space, the 4d gauge group and matter
    representations, see fig. (2.11).

    2.4.5 The Twisted Sectors
    As discussed before, the twisted sectors are constructed by the following procedure:
    • choose the inequivalent constructing elements g,
    • solve the equations (2.63) and (2.80) for massless right- and left-movers, and finally
    • use the orbifold projection eqn. (2.93) to get the invariant states.
    Here, we want to discuss briefly the interpretation of these twisted states as matter representation.
    The condition for massless right-movers eqn. (2.63) reads
    
    (q + vg)
    2
    2
    −
    1
    2
    + δc = 0 . (2.128)
    For a non-trivial constructing element g the zero-point energy is shifted by δc > 0. Consequently,
    (q + vg)
    2 < 1 and we see that twisted right-movers cannot give rise to vector bosons, i.e. q ̸=
    (±1, 0, 0, 0). The twisted sectors cannot provide additional gauge group factors, but only matter
    representations in the form of chiral multiplets. Such a chiral multiplet contains in general a state
    from g and its CPT conjugate from g
    −1
    : if qsh is a solution for vg, −qsh is a solution for vg−1 = −vg
    and if psh is a solution for Vg, −psh is one for Vg−1 = −Vg + λ with λ ∈ Λ. If furthermore g = g
    −1
    ,
    both (the state and its CPT partner) appear in the same sector. Having this in mind, we will from
    now on concentrate on the left-chiral states (with q
    0 = −
    1
    2
    ) and their bosonic SUSY partners. We
    
    will not list the right-chiral CPT conjugates (with q
    0 =
    1
    2
    ) and their SUSY partners any more.
    
    2.4.6 Anomalous U(1)
    The 4d gauge group generically contains many U(1) factors (in rare cases even 16 U(1)’s and no
    non-Abelian gauge group factor). It is well known that at most one U(1) factor can appear to
    be anomalous for heterotic orbifold models [17, 24, 25, 77, 78]. This factor is denoted by U(1)anom.
    All other gauge group factors (Abelian and non-Abelian) are anomaly-free. However, if we start
    with an arbitrary basis of U(1) generators and compute their anomalies it turns out that more
    than one U(1) appear to be “anomalous” in general. Nevertheless, we can always perform a basis
    change such that the anomaly is rotated to a single direction. In the following we will discuss in
    detail how to construct the anomalous U(1) gauge group and what are the conditions it has to
    obey.
    Identifying U(1)anom
    The Cartan generators of E8 × E8 or SO(32) are conventionally denoted by HI , I = 1, . . . , 16. By
    definition they act on left-moving states as
    HI
    |psh⟩L = p
    I
    sh|psh⟩L . (2.129)
    37
    
    38 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    Suppose we have n Abelian gauge group factors U(1)(i)
    
    , i = 1, . . . , n, in the 4d gauge group. They
    
    are generated by linear combinations of the Cartans, i.e.
    Qi = ti
    · H = t
    I
    i HI
    , (2.130)
    
    where we sum over I = 1, . . . , 16. The coefficients t
    I
    i
    could be from R, but it is more convenient
    
    to choose them as t
    I
    i ∈ Q. They have to be orthogonal to all simple roots αj of the non-Abelian
    
    gauge group factors, i.e. ti
    
    · αj = 0. Furthermore, we choose them to be orthogonal among each
    
    other, ti
    · tj = 0. Consequently, the i-th U(1) charge of the state |psh⟩L reads
    
    Qi
    |psh⟩L = (ti
    
    · H)|psh⟩L = (ti
    
    · psh)|psh⟩L , (2.131)
    
    in short form, Qi = ti
    
    · psh. Hence, we will also denote ti as the generator of the i-th U(1) factor.
    
    In principle, this U(1)(i)
    
    could be anomalous. To see this, we have to evaluate for example the
    U(1)(i) −grav−grav anomaly. It is proportional to the “trace” of Qi over all fermionic states with
    momenta p
    (f)
    sh
    
    Ai ≡ Tr Qi =
    X

    (f)
    i =
    X
    f
    ti
    · p
    (f)
    sh . (2.132)
    If this does not vanish the associated i-th U(1) factor is anomalous. Generically, starting with
    some arbitrary U(1) generators ti
    
    , many U(1) factors seem to be anomalous. However, we can
    construct the unique (up to a rescaling) generator tanom of the anomalous U(1)anom by using the
    anomaly coefficients Ai
    
    . In detail this reads18
    tanom ≡
    Xn
    i=1
    Ai
    ti
    · ti
    ti
    . (2.133)
    Since the generators ti are chosen to be orthogonal, we can easily read off the anomalous generator
    in terms of the shifted momenta psh [43]
    tanom =
    X
    i,f
    ti

    sh , (2.134)
    
    where the rescaling with the factor 1
    
    12 is the convention used in section 2.7.4. From here we can
    check that this is the desired result: the anomaly corresponding to tanom is non-vanishing
    
    Aanom =
    X
    f
    tanom · p
    (f)
    sh = 12|tanom|

    Conditions on U(1)anom
    For a U(1) gauge factor there are several possible anomalies:
    
    U(1)(i) − grav − grav, U(1)(i) − U(1)(i) − U(1)(i)
    ,
    U(1)(i) − G − G, and U(1)(i) − U(1)(j) − U(1)(j)
    ,
    
    (2.137)
    where G denotes a non-Abelian gauge group factor (like SU(2)) and i, j = 1, . . . , n. In the preferred
    basis where only the first U(1) is anomalous, the U(1)’s satisfy the following conditions [17, 34]

    U(1) is canceled by the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism [24] (i.e. by an anomalous variation
    of the B field, compare to section 2.2). It is important to note that an anomalous U(1) induces
    a so-called Fayet–Iliopoulos D–term [25, 26], a constant in Danom which is proportional to the
    anomaly Tr Qanom, i.e.

    2.5 Some Orbifolds
    In this section we will analyze the following orbifolds in some detail: Z3, Z3×Z3, Z6-II and Z2×Z2.
    As they will recur in the following chapters, we will discuss them here and refer to this section
    later on. The focus lies on geometrical aspects such as the torus lattice and its deformations, the
    fixed point structure and, in the case of the Z2×Z2 orbifold, on the difference between factorizable
    and non-factorizable torus lattices.
    2.5.1 The Z3 Orbifold
    As the Z3 orbifold can be seen as the simplest one, it has attracted a lot of attention in the
    literature [15–22, 79–83]. We will mainly use it in chapter 5 where we discuss the blow-up of Z3
    singularities. However, as it is instructive, we will discuss Z3 in detail here. The six-dimensional
    torus lattice is chosen to be Γ = SU(3) × SU(3) × SU(3), where each SU(3) sublattice lies inside
    one of the three complex planes, see figure (2.12). Furthermore, the generator θ of the Z3 point
    group is specified by the twist vector

    plus their scalar partners. These moduli describe continuous deformations of the torus lattice Γ,
    where each real (1, 1) modulus corresponds to one geometric parameter. Obviously, we need to
    identify nine geometric parameters that deform the torus lattice in such a way that the twist θ
    remains a symmetry. These parameters are [57, 69]
    
    R1, R3, R5 and α13, α15, α35, α14, α16, α36 . (2.143)
    Their geometric meaning as the three radii of the three SU(3) tori and six angles is presented in
    the appendix A.1. Furthermore, there it is shown that the twist θ remains a symmetry of the
    deformed torus lattices.

    ) for the gauginos and q = (−1, 0, 0, 0)
    for the gauge bosons. Thus, the rank of the 4d gauge group remains 16. The compactification of
    the charged gauge bosons and gauginos of the 10d gauge group E8 × E8 or SO(32) depends on the
    choices of the shift and the Wilson lines. As we have seen in section 2.4 they are subject to modular
    invariance conditions. In the case without Wilson lines (i.e. Aα = 0) and E8 × E8 (or SO(32))
    gauge group in 10d, there are only five (or six) inequivalent shifts leading to five (six) inequivalent
    Z3 orbifolds, respectively. They are listed in table (2.1) together with their resulting 4d gauge
    groups. Model A of E8×E8 and model A32 of SO(32) are the so-called standard embedding models.
    For them the twist v = (0, v1
    , v2
    , v3
    ) is embedded into the shift as V = (v

    we will explain model C in some detail. The roots of the unbroken gauge group are determined
    20In the case of a Calabi-Yau manifold the standard embedding is given by taking the gauge connection to be
    equal to the spin connection [63]. In terms of the curvature this means iF = R, see section 5.1.1

    where the first one turns out to be anomalous. In the case of the Z3 orbifold, the three right-

    orbifold group, i.e. q · v = −

    3 mod 1. Hence, states in the untwisted sector always appear with a
    multiplicity of three. We list the left-moving momenta p which combine with these right-movers
    (or their CPT conjugate) and form invariant matter states of the untwisted sector:

    The Twisted Sector
    For the twisted sectors, we will give only a few details and mainly state the results. Since the first
    twisted sector T(1) contains only the right-chiral CPT conjugates of the states from T(2), we can
    focus on the later one. As there are no Wilson lines all 27 fixed points are degenerate, i.e. have
    an identical copy of the massless spectrum. Thus, we can start with some constructing element,
    say
    θ
    2
    , 0
    
    . There, we compute the massless spectrum and multiply the result by 27 yielding
    the complete twisted matter spectrum. An efficient procedure to solve the equations for massless
    right- and left-movers is described in appendix B.3 of [84]. The result reads
    
    27(1, 14)
    (1,−
    1
    2
    )
    + 27(1, 1)(−2,1) + 81(1, 1)(1,1) . (2.146)
    
    2.5.2 The Z3 × Z3 Orbifold
    Like in the case of the Z3 orbifold, we choose the six-dimensional lattice to be factorized as
    Γ = SU(3) ×SU(3) ×SU(3). This torus allows for a Z3 ×Z3 point group, represented by the twist
    vectors
    
    v1 =
    0,

    . (2.147)
    From eqn. (2.10) we know that this choice will retain N = 1 supersymmetry in 4d. Furthermore,
    only three moduli are invariant:
    N1 ̄1
    , N2 ̄2 and N3 ̄3
    
    . (2.148)
    
    41
    
    42 CHAPTER 2. HETEROTIC ORBIFOLDS
    They correspond to deformations of three radii
    
    R1 = R2, R3 = R4 and R5 = R6 . (2.149)
    The number of inequivalent shift vectors has been classified in [44] taking into account that for
    ZN × ZM orbifolds shift vectors differing by lattice vectors can lead to inequivalent models. We
    will explain this in detail in section 3.1. All shifts and the resulting models for E8 ×E8 and SO(32)
    can be found in [85]. For more details on Z3 × Z3, we refer to e.g. [22, 86].
    2.5.3 The Z6-II Orbifold
    The Z6-II orbifold has recently become very popular [34, 36, 37, 39–41, 45–47, 87, 88]. Its point
    group is defined by the twist vector
    v =
    0,
    1
    6
    ,
    1
    3
    , −

    . (2.150)
    
    This is in contrast to Z6-I, where v =
    0,
    1
    6
    ,
    1
    6
    , −
    1
    3
    
    . The invariant moduli for Z6-II are three
    
    real (1, 1) moduli N1 ̄1
    , N2 ̄2
    , N3 ̄3 and one complex (1, 2) modulus N33 allowing for continuous
    deformations of in total five geometric parameters. From the form of the twist vector v we see
    that the first and fifth twisted sectors T(1) and T(5) contain fixed points (since vi ̸= 0 for i = 1, 2, 3),
    whereas T(2) and T(4) have fixed tori (due to 2v3 = 4v3 = 0 mod 1) and T(3) has fixed tori as well
    (3v2 = 0 mod 1). Their number and localization depend on the lattice. We choose the factorized
    torus lattice: it reads
    
    Γ = G2 × SU(3) × SU(2)2
    
    , (2.151)
    that is depicted in fig. (2.13), including the fixed point structure for the twisted sectors T(1), T(2)
    and T(3). The sectors T(4), T(5) are equivalent to T(2), T(1), respectively. For this lattice the five
    moduli correspond to deformations of four independent radii R1 = R2, R3 = R4, R5 and R6 and
    one angle α56. All inequivalent shift embeddings for E8 × E8 have been classified leading to 61
    different choices [89].
    2.5.4 The Z2 × Z2 Orbifold
    The Z2 × Z2 point group is generated by the twists θ and ω whose action on C3
    
    is defined by the
    
    corresponding twist vectors
    v1 =
    0,
    1
    2
    , −
    1
    2
    , 0
    
    and v2 =
    0, 0,
    1
    2
    , −
    1
    2
    
    . (2.152)
    From eqn. (2.10) we know that this choice will retain N = 1 supersymmetry in 4d. Before
    choosing a lattice, we can see that three real (1, 1) moduli N1 ̄1
    , N2 ̄2
    , N3 ̄3 are invariant, as usual. In
    addition, there are three complex (1, 2) moduli N11, N22, N33 giving rise to in total nine geometric
    deformation parameters. Their interpretation can only be specified after choosing a torus lattice.
    The four elements of the point group {1, θ, ω, θω} generate four sectors: the untwisted sector U
    and three twisted sectors, denoted by T(1,0), T(0,1) and T(1,1). Since the associated twist vectors
    v1, v2 and v3 = v1 + v2 have a zero-entry, there will be only fixed tori and no fixed points. The
    number of fixed tori per twisted sector, however, depends on the torus lattice. In the following we
    will discuss two examples for the torus lattice: a factorized one and a non-factorizable one.
    Factorized Lattice
    The prototype for a factorized lattice in the context of Z2 × Z2 orbifolds is Γ = SU(2)6
    . In this
    
    case the moduli correspond to six radii Ri = |ei
    
    | for i = 1, . . . , 6 and three angles α12, α23 and
    α56. Each twisted sector contains 16 fixed tori, in total 3 × 16 = 48. Further details on Z2 × Z2
    orbifolds on this lattice can be found in [35, 84].

    points and fixed tori of the T(1), T(2) and T(3) twisted sectors are depicted. Strings in the second
    (third) twisted sector are free to move in the third (second) complex plane.
    Non-Factorizable Lattice
    All inequivalent non-factorizable lattices Γ for the Z2×Z2 orbifold have been classified [90] leading
    to a total number of eight distinct lattices, denoted by A.1 to A.8. As an example, we choose the
    lattice Γ = SU(3)×SU(2)4 named A.2. In order to see that this lattice is non-factorizable we have
    to specify the vectors spanning the lattice Γ in C3
    
    e1 = (√
    2, 0, 0), e2 = (− √

    √
    2), e6 = (0, 0,
    √
    2i),
    
    (2.153)
    where we have fixed all radii and angles, as depicted in fig. (2.14). This lattice allows for the
    Z2 × Z2 point group generated by the twist vectors eqn. (2.152). Using the nine deformation
    parameters21 R1 = |e1| = 2|e

    |, Ri = |ei
    | for i = 3, . . . , 6, α13, α24 and α56 it cannot
    be deformed continuously to a factorized form. Thus, it is non-factorizable. Due to the special
    alignment of Γ inside C3
    
    , the number of inequivalent fixed tori changes compared to the factorized
    lattice. For example, in T(1,0) the constructing twist θ leaves in total 16 fixed tori invariant as
    in the factorized case. However, now θω identifies some of them leading to 12 inequivalent fixed
    tori, see fig. (2.15) for an illustration. Also in the other two twisted sectors T(0,1) and T(1,1) the
    number of inequivalent fixed tori is reduced, from 16 to 8 in both sectors. All 12 + 8 + 8 fixed tori
    are depicted in fig. (2.16). For a model on this lattice see section 3.3.

    2.6 Classification of ZN Orbifolds for SO(32)
    In this section we summarize the results from a classification of ZN orbifold compactifications
    of the SO(32) heterotic string without Wilson lines [42]. For each orbifold we choose a specific
    torus lattice. In detail, they read SU(3)3
    
    , SO(5)2 × SO(4), G2
    
    2 × SU(3), G2 × SU(3) × SO(4),
    SU(7), SO(9) × SO(5), SO(9) × SO(4), F4 × SU(3) and F4 × SO(4), listed according to the order
    of the ZN point groups in table (2.2). For the classification of the shift vectors V we use Dynkin
    diagram techniques, as described for example in [42, 50, 72, 91, 92]. The results are summarized in
    table (2.2a). From there, we see that generically there are more models in the SO(32) case than in
    E8 × E8 and the difference in the amount of respective models increases with increasing order N.
    More details on the SO(32) models, including the shift vectors V , the twist vectors v, the gauge
    groups and the resulting massless matter spectra can be found in [93]. Finally, we analyze the
    appearance of massless spinors of SO(10) and SO(12) for our SO(32) models22. It is a well-known
    fact that by breaking the adjoint of SO(32) we cannot obtain spinor representations of SO(2M).
    This can be seen from the length squares of the respective weights: the roots of SO(32) correspond
    to weights p of Spin(32)/Z2 with p
    
    2 = 2; on the other hand spinorial weights p of Spin(32)/Z2
    
    have a length squared p
    
    2 = 4. Thus, the latter one cannot be massless in the untwisted sector,
    see appendix C.1. However, they might be massless in some twisted sectors. In fact, in section
    3 of [42] it is shown that for all orbifolds ZN with N > 3 there exists a shift vector yielding a
    spinor 16 of SO(10) in the first twisted sector. These models might be excellent starting points
    for a “Mini-Landscape” of SO(32) heterotic orbifolds, compare to chapter 4. In addition, there
    are models where the spinor appears in higher twisted sectors. To summarize that, table (2.2b)
    lists the number of models equipped with spinor representations of SO(10) or SO(12) from any
    twisted sector.
    2.7 Yukawa Couplings
    Consider the n–point correlation function of two fermions and n − 2 bosons [54, 95]
    
    ⟨F F B . . . B⟩ . (2.154)
    The corresponding physical states shall be denoted by Ψr, r = 1, . . . , n. Then, in the field theory
    limit, a non–vanishing correlation function implies the following term in the superpotential
    W ⊃ Ψ1 Ψ2 Ψ3 . . . Ψn , (2.155)
    where the Ψr’s now denote the corresponding chiral superfields. A complete evaluation of eqn. (2.154)
    has only been performed for 3–point couplings and yields a moduli dependent coupling strength [54,
    22It was shown in [42] that massless spinors of bigger groups do not appear in orbifold models of the SO(32)
    heterotic string. For related work on SO(32) see [94].

    57,95,96]. On the other hand, symmetries of eqn. (2.154) give rise to the so–called string selection
    
    rules. These rules determine whether a given coupling vanishes or not. We use the following no-
    tation: the constructing elements of Ψr are denoted by gr ∈ S, their left-moving shifted momenta
    
    by psh,r and finally their R–charges by Rr, respectively. Then, the string selection rules read:

    inequivalent ZN models containing at least one spinor of SO(10) or SO(12). We also present the

    2.7.1 Gauge Invariance
    Invariance of eqn. (2.154) under variations in the gauge degrees of freedom result in a condition
    on the associated momenta psh: the sum over all left–moving shifted momenta psh,r must vanish:
    
    X
    r
    psh,r = 0 (2.156)
    This translates to the field theoretic requirement of gauge invariance for allowed terms in the
    superpotential.
    Anti-Symmetry under Particle Exchange
    If some field appears more than once in a given coupling, it is important to take care of the
    symmetry / antisymmetry properties under the exchange of identical particles. Let us see this
    by an easy example. Consider a theory with gauge group SU(2) and a particle content including
    some doublets and singlets. Furthermore, assume that the coupling 2 × 2 × 1 is allowed by all
    selection rules. Indeed, from gauge invariance it is clearly allowed, since the tensor product of two
    doublets contains a singlet, i.e.
    
    2 × 2 = 3s + 1a , (2.157)
    where s and a denote whether the representation is symmetric or antisymmetric under the exchange
    of the 2’s. Thus, if both doublets correspond to the same particle the singlet vanishes. We can
    also see this in the index notation, where Ai and Bj denote the components of the doublets. Then
    
    A
    iB
    j =

    (2.158)
    
    and the singlet 1a vanishes if both doublets are the same A = B. In appendix A.2, we give a long
    but not complete list of the most frequent such cases.

    This selection rule can be visualized as the geometrical ability of twisted strings to join. Consider
    the example of a 3–point coupling of strings with constructing elements g1, g2 and g
    −1
    3
    (choosing
    
    g
    −1
    3 will turn out to be more convenient than g3). In the covering space C3 of the orbifold C3/S
    the three strings look like open strings. Two “open” strings merge in order to give the third one.
    However, in order to be able to merge the boundary conditions have to multiply to the identity,
    see figure (2.17) for an illustration. We can evaluate the three boundary conditions at the time of
    merging,
    
    z3 = g3g2z2 = g3g2g1z1 = g3g2g1z3 (2.160)
    ⇒ g1g2g3 = 1 . (2.161)
    For computational purposes this condition is not very practical. For a given twisted string with
    constructing element gr this condition depends on the specific choice of gr ∈ [gr]. A given coupling
    might seem forbidden by the space group selection rule using gr ∈ [gr], but with a different choice
    g
    ′
    r ∈ [gr] it could turn out to be allowed. Thus, it is more convenient to reformulate this condition
    in terms of conjugate elements hrgrh

    kr )Λ, see for example [97]. Then, one can take any representative gr ∈ [gr] and
    each constructing element gr is conjugated independently by hr. Due to the definition of v it is
    enough to use pure rotations for hr, e.g. h1 = (θ, 0), h2 = (θ
    3
    , 0), h3 = (1, 0).

    r Ri
    r = −1 mod Ni and all Rr are bosonic. R–charge conservation can be understood as a
    remnant of ten-dimensional Lorentz invariance. In 10d couplings have to be invariant under the
    full Lorentz group SO(9, 1). This includes invariance under the action of
    
    e
    2πiα1J12 , e2πiα2J34 and e
    2πiα3J56
    , (2.164)
    
    where αi ∈ R and Ji,i+1 denote the Cartan generators as defined in eqn. (2.4). By the com-
    pactification, the SO(9, 1) breaks to the 4d Lorentz group SO(3, 1) times some “internal part”.
    
    In section 2.3 we discussed that for a generic compactification the internal part is SU(4), the R
    symmetry group of N = 4 supersymmetry. For Abelian orbifolds the R symmetry SU(4) is in
    general broken to a discrete subgroup of U(1)3 ⊂ SU(4) and the U(1)3
    
    corresponds to the three
    elements listed in eqn. (2.164). More specifically, there are unbroken discrete symmetries of the
    six-dimensional orbifold space. As they remain a symmetry of the space, they should also remain
    a symmetry of the theory, i.e. of the couplings. In the literature, these symmetries are often called
    sublattice rotations [18, 95, 98]. For factorizable torus lattices, the discrete remnants of the SU(4)
    R–symmetry are generated by three elements
    
    e
    2πiJ12/N1
    , e2πiJ34/N2
    and e
    2πiJ56/N3
    , (2.165)
    
    where Ni denotes the order of v
    i
    , as before. These elements generate an Abelian discrete R–
    
    symmetry group
    
    ZN1 × ZN2 × ZN3 . (2.166)
    Next, we have to clarify how this group acts on states compactified on the orbifold. Consider some
    generic state with possible oscillator excitations  ̃α, |qsh⟩R ⊗ α ̃|psh⟩L. Under a sublattice rotation
    in the i-th plane, it picks up a phase e
    2πiR
    i/Ni
    , compare to eqns. (2.65) and (2.66). Consequently,
    demanding invariance of the n-point coupling under these discrete transformations results in the
    conditions stated in eqn. (2.163). In the non-factorizable case, the situation seems unclear. For
    example, for the Z6-II orbifold with a Γ = SU(6) × SU(2) torus lattice the only discrete subgroup
    of U(1)3
    that maps the torus lattice Γ to itself is θ = e
    
    2πi(v1J12+v2J34+v3J56)
    
    , compare to [50]. Note
    that in this case θ is not an R symmetry in the strict sense as it commutes with the generator
    of supersymmetry and therefore all components of a SUSY multiplet carry the same R–charges.
    On the other hand, the non-factorizable torus lattice discussed in section 2.5.4 in the case of a
    Z2 ×Z2 orbifold allows for normal sublattice rotations. One can check that using the visualization
    of the lattice in fig. (2.14). In summary, it remains an open question how R–charge conservation
    is defined in the non-factorizable case.
    2.7.4 Discrete Anomalies
    
    The string selection rules listed in the previous sections clearly restrict the form of the superpoten-
    tial. Therefore, these rules can be understood in terms of discrete symmetries (obviously except
    
    for gauge invariance). Very much like continuous symmetries, discrete symmetries can be broken
    
    by quantum effects, i.e. have an anomaly [99]. If this is the case, one expects that the corre-
    sponding conservation laws be violated through non-perturbative effects. The criteria for discrete
    
    symmetries to be non-anomalous, and thus to be exact, have been studied in the Abelian (ZN )
    case [100, 101]. In [43] it is shown how to rederive the anomaly constraints using the path integral
    approach [102, 103] for Abelian and non-Abelian discrete symmetries. However, here we restrict
    to the case of a discrete ZN symmetry and the anomalies ZN − G − G and ZN -gravity-gravity are
    determined by

    compare to figure (1.2) in the introduction. If AZN −G−G and AZN −grav−grav are both integer the
    discrete symmetry is non-anomalous23
    .
    Discrete Anomalies for Z6-II Orbifolds
    As an example, we check whether the discrete symmetries of Z6-II orbifold models with torus
    lattice G2 ×SU(3)×SU(2)2 are anomalous. For details on Z6-II see section 2.5.3. In this case, the
    space group selection rule (2.159) can be interpreted as a Z6 × Z2 × Z

    where the sum runs over the n states involved in the coupling. Furthermore, the translational

    specify the localization of the states on the orbifold;
    here, we follow the conventions of [41]. Under this symmetry, each state comes with one Z6 charge
    k, two Z2 charges q2,q
    ′
    2 and one Z3 charge q3, all being integer and defined modulo the order of

    These anomalies turn out to be universal for the different gauge group factors G of a given model.
    However, generically they do not vanish. The discrete symmetries arising from the space group
    selection rule are consequently anomalous. We define the integer quantities kanom, n

    denotes the representation under all non-Abelian gauge group factors, e.g. R1 = (3, 2) of SU(3) × SU(2) which
    yields dim R1 = 6.

    and Wilson lines, where the coefficients are given by the discrete anomalies of the space group
    selection rule. For more details and further relations among discrete anomalies see [43].
    2.7.5 A Note on the γ Rule
    In the literature, there exists an additional selection rule, here referred to as the γ rule. In our
    notation, it reads [34, 57]
    
    X
    i
    γi = 0 mod 1 , (2.181)
    
    where γi denotes the gamma–phase of Ψi
    
    . In this section, it is argued that, in contrast to previous
    statements, a fully consistent approach yields to automatic fulfillment of the γ rule [47]. The
    discussion here is restricted to the case where Φvac = 1, for the general case with non-vanishing
    vacuum phase see appendix A.3. The correlation function corresponding to the coupling
    Ψ1 Ψ2 . . . Ψn (2.182)
    should be invariant under the action of the full space group. Let us assume first that the states Ψi
    corresponded to linear combinations of equivalent fixed points within the fundamental domain of
    the torus (see e.g. [34, 57, 69]). For example, in the case of the Z6–II orbifold only fixed points in
    the G2 lattice could form linear combinations. Under this assumption, different states Ψi would be
    eigenstates with respect to different space group elements. So one could not transform the coupling
    eqn. (2.182) with a given h = (θ
    l
    , mαeα). Thus, the fully consistent approach for building invariant
    linear combinations, as presented in section 2.4.1, is necessary. In this case, we can compute the
    gamma–phase for all states Ψi from eqn. (2.99), i.e. γi = γi(h) for arbitrary h = (θ
    l
    , mαeα). But
    since allowed couplings already fulfill the selection rules eqns. (2.156) and (2.163), the γ rule is
    satisfied trivially
    
    γi(h) = Ri
    
    · vh − psh,i · Vh , (2.183)
    
    ⇒
    X
    i
    γi(h) = X

    | {z }
    =0 see eqn. (2.156)
    
    ·Vh , (2.184)
    
    = 0 mod 1 .
    
    Thus, the γ rule in the fully consistent approach is not a selection rule. It is a consequence of
    other selection rules and invariance of the states. We therefore conclude that the coupling must
    only satisfy gauge invariance, R–charge conservation and the space group selection rule. This has
    important consequences. For example, in the model A1 of [34], there is no mass term for the exotics
    
    50
    
    2.7. YUKAWA COUPLINGS 51
    q ̄2q2 up to order 9 in singlets. However, it was found in [47] that the coupling  ̄q2q2S9S15S22S33
    is allowed by the selection rules of section 2.7. Further, using the prescription of section 2.4.1,
    the gamma–phases of the corresponding physical states are γi = ( 1

    , 0, 0,
    5
    6
    ,
    2
    3
    , 0) for h = (θ, 0) ,
    
    which sum up to 2. This is in contrast to [34], where γi = (0, 0, 0,
    1


. (3.60)

Including the parameter a, there are 10 independent discrete torsion parameters, which can take
values 0, 1
3
or 2
3
. For the Z2 × Z2 orbifold on an SU(2)6

lattice (as discussed in section 2.5.4) an
analogous consideration shows that there are no restrictions for the discrete torsion parameters.
Therefore, there are 1 + 6 + 6 + 15 = 28 independent parameters a, bα, cα, dαβ, with values either
0 or 1
2
. However, since the coefficients nαmβ of dαβ for (α, β) ∈ {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)} vanish, the
corresponding dαβ are not physical, leading to 25 effective parameters. In the case of the Z6-II
orbifold on a G2 × SU(3) × SU(2)2

torus lattice (cf. section 2.5.3) the following discrete torsion

parameters can in principle be non-vanishing: b3 = b4 = 0,
1
3
,
2
3
, b5, b6 = 0,
1
2
and d56 = 0,
1
2
.
However, the corresponding coefficients in the torsion phase eqn. (3.59) vanish. Thus, generalized
discrete torsion has no effect in Z6-II orbifolds.
Generalized Discrete Torsion and Local Spectra
In order to understand the action of the generalized discrete torsion, let us consider the following
example. We start with the Z3 × Z3 standard embedding without Wilson lines, Aα = 0, and
switch on the discrete torsion phase, eqn. (3.59), with b3 = b4 =
1
3
. The total number of families
is reduced from 84 (27, 1) to 24 (27, 1) and 12 (27, 1). For details on the spectrum see table (B.3)
in the appendix. Due to its form, the discrete torsion phase ε = e

2πi bα (k1 mα−t1 nα) distinguishes
between different fixed points of a particular twisted sector. That is, generalized discrete torsion
can be thought of as a local feature. In general, the additional phase at a given fixed point
coincides with a brother phase of the torsionless model (cf. first term of eqn. (3.56)), i.e. locally
one can find ∆Vi such that
ε = e
2πi bα (k1 mα−t1 nα) = e

−2πi (k1 t2−k2 t1)(V2·∆V1− x
3 )

(3.61)
with appropriate x. Then, each local spectrum coincides with the local spectrum of some brother
model. The interpretation of generalized discrete torsion in terms of ‘localized discrete torsion’
parallels the concept of local shifts (cf. [35, 37, 41, 111]) in orbifolds with Wilson lines. Note that
∆Vi as in eqn. (3.61) cannot be found for twisted sectors where bα corresponds to a direction eα
of a fixed torus, where bα projects out all states of the sector. For concreteness, we first focus on
the three fixed points in the second torus of the T(0,1) twisted sector. As depicted in figure (3.5),
the local spectra of the three brother models,
a ≡ − 
V2 · ∆V1 −

3

= 0,
1
3
,
2
3
, (3.62)

can be combined consistently into one model with b3 = b4 =
1
3
. On the other hand, in the
T(1,0) twisted sector there is a fixed torus in the directions e3, e4; thus the sector is empty. This
procedure can also be applied to the terms cα and dαβ of the generalized discrete torsion phase,
eqn. (3.59).
Generalized Brother Models versus Generalized Discrete Torsion
As in our previous discussion in section 3.1, also the generalized versions of the discrete torsion
phase and the brother phase have a very similar form. Indeed, whenever there are non-trivial
solutions to the eqns. (3.55), one can equivalently describe models with generalized discrete torsion
phase in terms of generalized brother models. This is the generic case. However, there are

exceptions. Namely, as we will explain below, models with dαβ ̸= 0 in Z3 × Z3 orbifolds without
Wilson lines cannot be interpreted in terms of brother models. Consider the fourth part of the

by choosing ∆Aα ∈ Λ such that

On the other hand, in the case when Aα = 0 and ∆Aα ̸= 0, eqn. (3.64) simplifies to

where the second equality follows from the definition of zαβ, eqn. (3.55c). As ∆Aα are lattice vec-
tors, this equality can only hold if zαβ = 0 mod 3, which implies that the brother phase eqn. (3.66)

is trivial. Thus, in this case, the generalized discrete torsion phase leads to models which cannot
arise by adding lattice vectors to shifts and Wilson lines. In summary, the generalized discrete
torsion phases admit more possible assignments than the generalized brother phases. Nevertheless,
a large class of the models with generalized discrete torsion has an equivalent description in terms

of models with a modified gauge embedding. These results have important implications. By intro-
ducing generalized discrete torsion, or lattice-valued Wilson lines, one can control the local spectra.

One can therefore expect that introducing generalized discrete torsion, or alternatively shifting
the Wilson lines by lattice vectors, will gain a similar importance as discrete Wilson lines [14] for
orbifold model building. As stated above, switching on generalized discrete torsion can lead to
the disappearance of complete local spectra. This raises the question of how to interpret this fact
in terms of geometry. Some of the localized zero-modes can be viewed as blow-up modes which
allow to resolve the orbifold singularity associated to a given fixed point [54, 95, 104, 112, 113] (see
chapter 5 and [48, 114–116] for recent developments). If at a given fixed point there are no zero
modes, one might argue that, therefore, the associated singularity cannot be ‘blown up’. In what
follows, we shall advertise an alternative interpretation.

Table 3.1: Examples of Z2 × Z2 orbifolds with generalized discrete torsion. The 2nd–4th columns
list the number of anti-families and families, respectively, for the various sectors T(k1,k2)
. In all
models, the untwisted sector gives a contribution of (3, 3) (anti-)families. #S denotes the total
number of singlets. These spectra can either be obtained by turning on generalized discrete torsion
dαβ as specified in the next-to-last column, or by using lattice-valued Wilson lines Aα as listed in
the last column, compare to eqn. (3.67).
3.3 Connection to Non-factorizable Orbifolds
In this section it is shown that in many cases orbifold models M with certain geometry, i.e. torus
lattice Γ, and generalized discrete torsion switched on are equivalent to torsionless models M′
based on a different lattice Γ′

. Model M′ has less fixed points than M, and the mismatch turns out
to constitute precisely the ‘empty’ fixed points of model M. The simplest examples are based on
Z2 × Z2 orbifolds with standard embedding and without Wilson lines. As compactification lattice
Γ, we choose an SU(2)6

lattice, as discussed in section 2.5.4. As we have seen in section 3.2.2, in
this case there are 25 physical parameters for generalized discrete torsion, with values either 0 or
1
2
. For concreteness, we restrict to the 12 dαβ parameters and scan over all 212 models. Beside
other models with a net number of zero families4

, we find eight models (and their mirrors, i.e.
models where families and anti-families are exchanged). They are listed in table (3.1), where we
present the number of (anti-)families for each twisted sector and the total number of singlets. As
discussed in section 3.2.2, models with non-trivial dαβ are equivalent to torsionless models with
lattice-valued Wilson lines. Possible representatives of these Wilson lines can be composed out of
the building blocks

and are listed in the last column of table (3.1).
Relations between different Z2 × Z2 Constructions
Models leading to spectra coinciding with the ones in table (3.1) have already been discussed
in the literature. They appeared first in reference [117] in the context of free fermionic string
models related to the Z2 × Z2 orbifold with an additional freely acting shift (see also [118, 119]).
4More details on models with a net number of zero families can be found in the table (B.5) in the appendix.

66 CHAPTER 3. DISCRETE TORSION

More recently, new Z2 × Z2 orbifold constructions have been found in studying orbifolds of non-
factorizable six-tori [90,120]. We find that for each model M of table (3.1) there is a corresponding

‘non-factorizable’ model M′ with the following properties:
(i) Each ‘non-empty’ fixed point, i.e. each fixed point with local zero-modes, in the model M
can be mapped to a fixed point with the same spectrum in model M′
.

(ii) The number of ‘non-empty’ fixed points in M coincides with the total number of fixed points
in M′
.
Generalization to ZN × ZM and Interpretation
These relations are not limited to Z2×Z2 orbifolds, rather we find an analogous connection also in
other ZN ×ZM cases, see table (B.6) in the appendix (ZN ×ZM orbifolds based on non-factorizable

compactification lattices have recently been discussed in [121]). This result hints towards an in-
triguing impact of generalized discrete torsion on the interpretation of orbifold geometry. What

the (zero-mode) spectra concerns, introducing generalized discrete torsion (or considering gener-
alized brother models) is equivalent to changing the geometry of the underlying compact space,

Γ → Γ
′
. To establish complete equivalence between these models would require to prove that
the couplings of the corresponding states are the same, which is beyond the scope of the present
study. It is, however, tempting to speculate that non-resolvable singularities, as discussed above,
do not ‘really’ exist as one can always choose (for a given spectrum) the compactification lattice
Γ in such a way that there are no ‘empty’ fixed points.
3.4 How to classify ZN × ZM Orbifolds
In [44] it is shown how to use the knowledge obtained from discrete torsion to classify ZN × ZM
orbifolds using the concept of brother models. The strategy is exemplified for the case of Z3 × Z3
orbifolds resulting in 120 and 131 inequivalent shift-embeddings in the case of E8×E8 and SO(32),
respectively. More details can be found in [44, 50, 85].`
